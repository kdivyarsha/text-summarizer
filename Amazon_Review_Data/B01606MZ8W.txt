R2RLXDL2CDQVYE	5.0	I love it, but you might not.	218	223	It seems like the big question right now is, "Do I get the Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book?" I'll explain why I chose the Surface Pro 4, but first, a quick about me. I am a college student majoring in EECS and I commute 4 hours a day by bus so having a light backpack is important to me. The S.Book is almost two times heavier than the SP4. It packs much more computing power than the SP4, but as an EECS major, I don't need the extra power that the S.Book has. I don't plan to play any intensive games or render/animate things so the SP4 fits my needs better. The S.Book also has a $400 higher price tag ($270 if you get the Type Cover for the SP4) that I'm not willing to pay for unneeded performance. I haven't tried the S.Book's keyboard, but the SP4's keyboard feels great to type on and other reviewers have said both keyboards are amazing. Reading textbooks or other PDF's feels much more natural with the SP4's tablet form. The S.Book without the keyboard only has a battery life of 3 hours, and although it can be used with the keyboard 'wrapped' around the back, I think that it'll only be a hassle for me to deal with. I'd rather not deal with having to detach the S.Book every time I want to use it in tablet mode. If you plan to render/animate things you should probably consider going with the Surface Book. Otherwise, I highly recommend the Surface Pro 4 for doing everyday/light to medium tasks. Now onto the actual Surface Pro 4 Review. I love the SP4. In the past year, I've owned an iPad Air, MacBook Pro, and the Razer Blade 2015. The SP4 fits my needs the best by far. The SP4 replaces both my textbooks and notebooks. For me, this is a big deal because I no longer have to carry around my notebooks, textbooks, and supplemental writing materials (highlighters, etc). The Surface Pen tips can be replaced with other pen tips to change the writing "feedback" feeling but the stock pen tip feels great. OneNote keeps all my notes organized and being able to access them from any device is incredibly convenient. Using the Surface Pen for writing on textbooks and PDF's is also very useful. I've been getting ~7-9 hours of battery life on the SP4 which is more than enough to get me through a school day. The screen is not too small like the iPad, neither is it bulky like a laptop. The screen resolution is high and text/videos are crisp and easy to read/watch. The magnet on the left side of the SP4 is surprising strong and holds the Surface Pen well. The magnet on the right side is significantly weaker (maybe because all the I/O ports are on this side) but it can hold the pen well. The kickstand works perfectly and stays in the position I set it to. The SP4 Type Cover feels great and protects your screen when you aren't using it. Gaming shouldn't be the main reason you buy the SP4, but it could run some games if you decide to do so. I did try running StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm and the SP4 handled it pretty well. I wouldn't even bother trying to run more demanding games such as GTAV on the SP4. That being said, the gaming experience was rather unpleasant. You should consider the Surface Book if you plan to game on-the-go frequently. Software-wise, I don't have much to comment on. It looks and performs exactly like Windows 10 should on a normal desktop or laptop. I've never used the Microsoft Store and don't intend to so I don't know much about the apps that are available on the SP4. The only con I found with this device is the fact that it only has a single USB port. It's inconvenient when I'm using the SP4 with a mouse and I need to use my flash drive. I haven't had any overheating issues and I can't find any issues with the build quality. In closing, I don't think anyone else offers the performance and quality that the Surface Pro 4 has in the same lightweight and thin chassis. It is incredibly versatile and it has replaced many heavy and cumbersome objects in my bag. I'll update this review as I continue to use the SP4. Feel free to leave questions/comments and I will try my best to answer them.
R1C2ZZLC3E5Z3J	4.0	Great productivity tablet with a handful of notable drawbacks	84	90	I have had a love/hate relationship with tablets for years now. Previously, I'd tested the waters with Android tablets- which were and still are the cheapest ones available. I've used everything from the original Kindle Fire to the 2013 Nexus 7, and I no longer own any of them. There's a good reason for this, as I found in general that they did not really fill any role in my day: they for the most part are only good for browsing, watching some videos, and checking (but not really answering) email. Anything more, and a keyboard and mouse of some sort are still pretty essential. Additionally, (though it is improving) the Android app ecosystem still doesn't cut it for most productivity tasks. The reason I divested myself of these Android tablets (numbering some 5 in all) is I realized two things: my phone could do anything these could do, sometimes better- and tablets were a lot less portable. Then came along the first Windows 8 tablets, and I decided to give one a try. The first wave included several interesting Atom-powered entries, and I settled on the ASUS VivoTab Note 8. The reason I even considered another tablet foray was that these things ran full-up Windows and, in the VivoTab's case, included a full version of Office 2013. The idea that I could have a tablet that could run all my Windows programs (within hardware limits, of course) was tempting: now it's not just a leisure device but can also theoretically get some work done. The VivoTab Note 8 was also pretty inexpensive, and had an interesting feature with an integrated Wacom stylus. Long story short: it is a good device, but I found the size was a blessing and a curse. It's small enough to be portable, but also small enough to be hard to do anything serious without squinting. I did like the stylus, but found the build quality to be a bit on the weak side, and also had some random issues with the touch and digitizer dropping out. Additionally, while the Atom Baytrail was not bad for a fanless budget low-power CPU, it wasn't exactly dressed to impress either- especially with only 2 GB of RAM. However, this tablet did convince me of the fact that a productivity tablet was not entirely ridiculous. It just needed to be a bit bigger, faster, and less rickety for me to make really good use of it. After a while, another thing happened that made this a bit more of an imperative: the building I'm working in stopped letting us park there (don't ask- it doesn't make sense to me either) and so I was stuck hauling my Core i7 work laptop into the office from a distant public parking lot every day. Sure, it's not that heavy, but when you start carrying these things around for more than 5 mins a day you start to realize they aren't exactly light either. I was originally considering an older Surface Pro as portable work solution, but it just so happens that the Surface Pro 4 was just about to come out. The thing that made me even look at this (much less pay the hefty price for it) is the introduction of the 6th-generation 'Skylake' CPUs. These promise to use less power and produce less heat than the older generation units, which I noted also had a lot of customer complaints about overheating. There were an equal or greater number of complaints about battery life in the original Surface Pro as well, which kind of turned me off despite the very low prices they are available for now. My first choice for the Pro 4 was the Core M3 powered unit, which looked like it would have better battery life and run quieter. However, I was having a really hard time nailing down any sort of performance comparison vs. other options. By that, I mean it is obviously slower than the i5 offering and obviously faster than an Atom... but how much slower or faster? Nobody seemed able to give me a straight answer- even the folks at the local Microsoft Store or the Intel forums. The answer seems to be that it depends on what you're doing, whether it's GPU heavy or not, and whether you're multitasking a lot or not. Overall, the best I could get was 'it is noticeably slower than the i5, but probably enough for most tasks.' There weren't even any display models available for me to look at, so I decided it was better to be safe than sorry: the i5 definitely has enough power for my needs, and it was only $100 more. Note that this is not a cheap machine. You can definitely get a cheaper one with similar specs from other manufacturers. I was eyeing another ASUS (the Transformer Chi) but decided I'd given ASUS a shot and it was time for something a bit better in terms of build quality. However, if you're on a budget- you shouldn't even be reading this. There's cheaper offerings out there that will probably work very well. Overall, my impression of the Surface Pro 4 has been favorable. In particular, it's got an amazing screen, solid build quality, is very light, and does not get too hot. It isn't exactly a one-handed device, but I knew that going in (hot tip: go find a store somewhere and hold it- pictures don't really do it). The device is very responsive in general and in particular has ridiculously fast storage. I appreciate the full size USB 3.0 port and the fact that it has a separate charge port. I do wish it had a micro HDMI instead of the mini DisplayPort- needing an adapter for that is kind of lame, though I suppose it does give you the option of using DVI or VGA if that's all you have. The only thing that might be a dealbreaker for some people is the battery life. This is definitely not the longest-lasting machine out there, though it's not bad for a Windows tablet. Compared to most modern ultrabooks, however- let's just say you'll probably be disappointed if that's your number one feature. I found that when doing actual work, it lasts about 4.5 hrs off a charge- though granted that was with about 50% screen brightness which is probably not necessary in most situations. The screen is very bright even at 30%, which is what I've dialed it down to to save power- however, even at pretty minimal settings I only get about 6 non-idle hours. This is usually enough for my needs, but it might not be for everyone. On the plus side there, the tablet does charge quite quickly and the fans do not seem to kick in very often- a quick check of power use showed that the screen was eating up over 90% of it which is probably not surprising considering how big, high-res, and bright it is. Other notes: the new Surface Pen is very nice, with the tail end acting as an eraser. Not sure why this is so rare in tablet styluses, but it makes too much sense. I did have some issues with the type cover's trackpad turning itself off, but it looks like a software problem and will probably be fixed in an update. The tablet's cameras are also quite good, though I don't consider that a huge plus as I'm not going to be using this for picture taking. I stuck a 128 GB micro SD which effectively doubled the storage on my model. It's not nearly as fast as the internal storage, but it's fast enough for storing documents and such- leaves the main drive available for applications and other things I need to run fast. I have not seen any RAM problems with the 4GB model, and it's a pretty pricey step up to the 8/256. Granted, I'm not gaming on this machine- but this is not really meant to be a gaming platform to begin with. Pro: Incredible screen Great performance (running Core i5/128GB model) Pen input that is a step above competition Sleek, light design Type cover has great feel Integrated kickstand that actually works in all positions Separate magnetic charge connector, common with SP3 Full size USB 3 Expandable storage (micro SD) Con: Expensive (and more with the cover) Mini Displayport needs adapters Mediocre battery life I would recommend this tablet for professionals that walk or travel a lot, and do NOT need all day battery on a single charge. You're going to need at least one outlet lunch break with this device. If you can hack that, go for it- it's a powerful and portable device that can basically do anything a laptop can. If not, you might want to consider some of the more long-legged ultrabooks on the market.
R1325VHVMSH5UU	5.0	The Golden Question ➽ Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book..?!!	107	116	✓✓✓ You will love the Surface Pro 4 if: ☛ If you care about the using it as a tablet AND as a laptop. Surface Book screen is bit too large to serve as a tablet (“clipboard” as they call it), plus in the clipboard mode it has under 3 hours of battery life. So the Surface Book is going to stay as a laptop for the most part of its life, unless carrying around a 13.5” inch tablet (Oops, Sorry..Clipboard..!!) is one amongst your hobbies. NO, the keyboard won't charge the Surface Book Screen when docked - Don't let your imagination run wild..!! ☛ If you care about the light package that Surface Pro 4 offers. There is a difference in almost a pound on the weight between the two, plus the dimensions are smaller for SP4 compared to Surface Book, which adds to the ease of carrying it around. ☛ If you care about fact that Surface Pro 4 is the 4th iteration of surface devices, while the Surface Book is the first ever attempt from Microsoft to build the “ultimate laptop”. By thumb rule, this means that Microsoft should have ironed out a lot of issues and bugs from the previous generation of Surface Pro devices - so the SP4 shouldn’t ideally be a bumpy ride. While the "dynamic fulcrum hinge”, "muscle wire lock" and that mysterious Custom Nvidia dGPU in the Surface Book will now need to stand the test of time to prove it’s reliability and durability and gain the customer trust. ☛ If you don’t care about the diminished battery life on the SP4. This is where my major gripe lies as well on the SP4. The surface book has an amazing 12 hours (some reviewers even say 14 hours) as compared to 7-9 hours on SP4 i5 Processor. The SP4 i7 most probably won’t last that long. It’s interesting to note that some reviewers have managed to clock in almost 13 hours on an i7 Surface Book in their Wifi Browsing tests, which is phenomenal. Very heavy usage (WebGL Tests - 200 Nits) results in 6 hours for Surface Book i7, while a meagre 3.5 hours for SP4. Basically, SP4 offers only a marginal improvement in battery life compared to the older SP3. ☛ If you don’t care about the entire “lapability” episode the world whines about. By the way, there are still a lot of people out there who are comfortable typing on a pro 4 while on their lap. This argument varies from one person to the other, as I have seen with the Pro 3 users already. ☛ If you don’t care about the absence of a discrete Nvidia GPU that the surface book offers. I am personally fine with that, as I am not exactly a gamer. The i7 SP4 offers Intel Iris 540 which could offer enhanced graphics experience for 3D modelling, Photoshops and gaming. Beware of the fact that the SP4 i7 battery life could be very well a bottleneck though, considering its track record with the i5 processor so far. ☛ If you don’t care about the slightly smaller display on the Pro 4 (12.3” Vs 13.5” on the Surface Book), which of course helps keep the entire package compact on SP4. Both screens are gorgeous with the same pixel density of 267 ppi. The guys at DisplayMate have written an exhaustive article on why the SP4’s display is the best in business (http://ow.ly/U1Wvc). Worth a read, considering the fact that accolades like this are usually only crowned upon Apple products. ☛ Keyboard is fine on both. If you look around, reviewers are all praises about the Pro 4 and the surface book keyboard. Some guys even like the Pro 4 keyboard better. ☛ Performance could be close on both depending on the configuration - of course barring the gaming use-case, where Surface Book would excel more. ☛ Price comes close as well, when SP4+Type Cover is compared with Surface Book. The Book is slightly costlier, but if you ask me, that price difference should NOT influence you to make the decision - as the investments you would end up making on either devices is premium. ….So there you go, either devices has its "Wow.!!" and "Meh.!!" moments.. So, the decision is ALL YOURS depending on your use-case and requirements 👍 👍 👍..!!
RSQLCNNSE9R27	3.0	Great Hardware; But Update and Hope for More Updates	40	41	Usually a three star review represents an average product. This three star review represents half of a five-star product and half of a one-star product. At the moment, I feel like I have Schrodinger's Surface: either it's going to be my primary computer for a few years, or I'm going to return it and curse Microsoft's name. It all depends on whether, and how quickly, Microsoft fixes the various bugs that are currently part of the Surface Pro 4 experience. First, the positives: If you've played with the Surface Pro 3, you know that you can fry an egg on it after 15 minutes of use. The Surface Pro 4 has fixed this, which means it's actually viable as a tablet for an extended time. The touch screen is very responsive. This is my first touch screen computer, and I'm surprised how often I find myself reaching up and scrolling instead of using the keyboard's trackpad. The pen is great. It took me about a day to get used to writing with it (my notes during the first day are irredeemable), but since then I haven't picked up my paper notebook. The pen shines best in OneNote, PDF annotation (SP4 comes with an amazing app, Drawboard PDF) and the art apps (SP4 comes with FreshPaint, which is a joy). The pen is also useful in other apps too: I use it to select text in the browser and in documents, and to extend calculations in Excel. The screen looks great. Windows 10 is a great step forward. OneNote is just really cool. The keyboard is amazing. Next, the negatives: As shipped, your battery will drain while the computer is asleep, even quicker than when it's awake. You can fix this by updating your battery driver, but it's a problem out of box. Browsing certain sites causes the computer serious problems. The screen will flash various colors, and eventually blink out with an error message. Occasionally, it will force the computer to restart. Edge, the Internet Explorer replacement, while buggy itself (it refuses to load about one in every three sites), is a lot worse on the Surface, for some reason. I expected Microsoft hardware to play nice with Microsoft software, but that hasn't been my experience so far. I'm so used to on-screen keyboards reading my mind and appearing whenever I need to type. Surface (or perhaps Windows 10) has a long way to go in that department. When I first started using the Surface, it would crash nearly every time the screen rotated. This was fixed by an update. The Surface's screen resolution presents problems with a lot of non-Microsoft Products, and buttons will show up tiny. The Surface doesn't seem like to attach programs to the very top of the screen--locking a program to the top leaves a centimeter or so of the desktop at the top, even for Office Products. The microphone seems to occasionally, and randomly, fail. The camera didn't work out of box either--you have to update in the Windows Store. Microsoft support. My pen's eraser cursor no longer registers, and I've tried three separate times to troubleshoot it using Microsoft's online support team. The first time, I think the guy used my question to go on break, and after 20 minutes he had done little more than verify my account. The last person had me go through all the troubleshooting steps, then once that didn't work, claimed that he scheduled a call with the resolutions team. The call never came. At this point, I prefer a broken product over working with the support team. Overall, it is a great piece of hardware. Windows 10 is a huge step forward and the Office Suite is unparalleled for productivity, especially with OneNote. The hardware and software don't work together. With all the bugs, you will have to spend quite a bit of time just keeping your Surface in working condition. If you don't mind doing that, you will eventually have a great computer and a very good tablet. Just don't get it for your tech-novice relative.
R286SH9SULSU4B	3.0	Mixed opinion.	24	25	I received the SP4 one day after it was released and I have been working with it now for three weeks. I have been using a MacBook Pro 15" inch for the last 7 years and iPad since 2011. Here are my impressions: - I think the best use for the SP4 is a "mobile desktop". The SP4 shines when connected to an external monitor and wireless keyboard & mouse. I say mobile desktop because it is 1.7 lbs, so moving it between my home office and work office is extremely easy. Just plug it and you have a full powerful desktop. I give it here 5/5 stars. I would give my older Macbook Pro 4/5 because is is heavier, 4.7 lbs, to carry around - I think the second best use is tablet. While its SW is not optimized for touch and it is not light like iPad Air (1lb), I still think the combination of the large screen 12" (dedicated for single app), kickstand, and stylus is great, so I give it in that regard 4/5 and I give my iPad 3.5/5. - I think the worst use for SP4 is laptop mode. In laptop mode, the screen becomes small for multiple apps; furthermore, the highly reflective screen makes it hard to work for a long time on it. I give it here a score of 3/5 while I give my Macbook Pro 5/5. Overall I give it 3/5 because of the poor battery life that does not last beyond 4-5 hours of real use. Is it for you? It depends on how to use it. If you are a road warrior always working in hotels, airplanes and cafes, then I do not think you should get it. If you plan to spend 70-80% of the time pairing it with a large screen and wireless keyboard then definitely get it. If you really need a stylus (teachers and students) in tablet mode then get it. If there is no urgent need, then you should wait because the SW has lots of bugs and MS is still rolling out critical updates. In terms of HW, I feel the worst aspects are 1) poor battery life, 2) high reflectively screen, 3) power button next to volume button, and 4) one USB slot.
R2N7L438U71OCJ	4.0	Technical issues aside.., pretty solid device	15	15	Review is for the 256GB/8gb ram/i5 Surface Pro 4. Thought I'd offer my thoughts garnered mostly to the "casual" consumer that has money to burn/likes new gadgets/will mostly just do games/general office & PDF processing/web browsing/watching movies. I’ll start with the Cons, mostly because if you can get past them, it’s a pretty solid device. Cons: 1. Fingerprint scanner on the typecover (if you opt for the fingerprint ID typecover) is finicky 2. Expensive (just over $1500USD for 256gb/i5/8GB RAM SP4 version, typecover & tax) 3. Technical issues. Freezing, screen flickering, bluetooth connectivity issues, trackpad issues, and camera issues for the first two days. Two of the three technical support reps admitted to there being various issues on a number of the SP4 devices, but that future software updates should smooth things out. Their recommendation was to do a factory reset each time for the freezing/Bluetooth connectivity issues. Yea… I did two factory resets in two days. That’s two too many for a $1500 device, but that was their only suggested fix. Wasn’t all that thrilled with technical support either, come to think of it. That said, there certainly has been a number of updates, and all things aside for the first two days, all has been well for the last two days (fourth day of owning the device). 4. Battery life. It doesn’t have much of one. About 4.5-6.5 hours of use depending on what you’re using it for. Dunno how some “professional” reviews were remarking on 8 hour battery life. That would be a … no? Only about 4 hours worth if you’re doing gaming. 70% charge time is just about 2 hours, so I’d predict a 0-100% would be close to 2.5-3 hours. 5. Runs a little warm, particularly during gaming. 6. Windows App store is pretty pitiful, still, compared to Android/Apple, but, fortunately, there’s generally a “PC” equivalent app that can be used just fine. 7. Virtual keyboard doesn’t pop with use of Pen (only with “finger tap”), which is odd. Two online chat reps didn’t have a fix, and they, too, said they’ve had a lot of customers questioning it. There's a couple of other odd things with the pen as well that should work, but don't. Pros: 1. Fully functional windows… which is fascinating along with the idea of a tablet/laptop hybrid with a fully functioning OS, rather than a mobile version. I realize this isn’t the first of its kind, and I realize there have been other Surface devices, but with Windows 10, I’m on board. 2. Crisp graphics for gaming/movie watching 3. Slim/Light even with typecover attached. 4. Awesome typecover. No issues with connectivity and/or typing. The hype on the typecover isn’t overrated (not necessary to spend an additional $30 for the Fingerprint ID one though which is a tad lackluster) 5. MicroSD & USB, though I haven’t used the USB much as most of my peripherals can be run via bluetooth 6. Multitasking is smooth/more than enough processing for two-three windows at the same time. Personally, I tend to run an MS Office program (usually Access/Excel/Word/OneNote) and youtube/Netflix (or Hulu, depending) simultaneously. 7. Gaming. So, I don’t see myself using this tablet for hardcore gaming, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it running two different MMOs smoothly (not at the same time of course). No issues with graphics (after adjusting settings) or with single player/solo questing/crafting/movement. I’d recommend at least 8GB ram though and probably 256GB storage. If SP4 can run an MMO style game (I tested 1.5 hour play time on ESO & SWTOR before I uninstalled both as I won't be using the SP4 for either), my reasoning is it can run virtually any other game. Big Fish PC games work too (not their “mobile” version though, unless purchased from app store). So, overall verdict… Yea. I love it. I didn’t love the technical issues, and there were plenty of them. I’m rather surprised I didn’t return it, as my tolerance for technical issues, on such an expensive product, is slim. I’m kind of glad I didn’t return it. Do I need it? No, not really. I already have too many gadgets (tablets for apple/android, laptops, PCs, ereaders, smartphone of course), but this *is* my first hybrid, and I suspect I’ll only get hybrids from now on. Is there a need for the Surface Book in lieu of the SP4? For me, that’s a definitive no. The SP4 i5/256gb/8gb ram is more than enough power to run anything I might use. If you can get past the poor battery life and you’re a casual user (as I am, aside from Office stuff/PDF/Occasional work video conferencing). There’s only three reasons you’ll want to consider the surface book IMO: 1) You need longer battery life due to being highly mobile throughout the day and not being near a charger. Note that the battery life is only strong for the book in full laptop mode 2) You need higher end specs/processing whether for work and/or play 3) You have (more) money to burn and want top of the line specs just because (resist this temptation :)).
R2UJMOUFKZ1GRP	4.0	Great Machine, if you're part of a very small subset of people.	24	27	I’ve always pushed against the notion that Microsoft and Apple were “competing computer titans.” While they both certainly showed up in the same market of personal computing, they didn’t have the same business model. Apple designed its software in concert with its own devices, and produced everything in house, so unless you’re a high quality nerd, the only way you’re getting OSX is to purchase an iProduct. Microsoft on the other hand, has traditionally designed only software, attempting to get it to run on all the OEMs it could strike a deal with. In 2012, Microsoft challenged that trend with the original Microsoft Surface, stepping into the sphere of in-house design that Apple has always dominated. They introduced the Surface with a Highlanderesque attitude of “There can only be ONE (device).” The surface was intended to replace both your laptop and your tablet, and packed specifications to back up their claims. With each generation of Surface since then, Microsoft has notably listened to those who purchased the machines and responded by incorporating requested features into new designs. The Surface Pro 3 was a marvel of engineering, and so is the new Surface Pro 4, it seems. For a tablet that can replace your laptop, the Surface Pro 4 is very light and small. It weighs approximately 1.7 pounds (766-786g, for everyone who isn’t American). The core m3 shaves a few grams off, due to not having an active cooling system. It measures 11.5x7.93x.33 freedom units (292.10 x 201.42 x 8.45 mm), making it a few millimeters thinner than the previous Surface Pro 3, at the expense of battery capacity apparently. (More on that later.) The Surface Pro 4 is configurable with a core m3, i5, or i7 sixth generation processor, 4-16GB of RAM, and anywhere between 128GB and 1TB of SSD storage, depending on how thick your pocketbook is. Where this tablet really shines is the screen. Microsoft put in an insane screen, with a resolution of 2736x1824. How they arrived at that resolution, I’ll never know. I can only assume some engineers pulled numbers out of a hat, and 2736x1824 were the winners. “The hat has spoken, Gabe!” That screen measures 12.3,” thanks to Microsoft finally deciding to trim the bezels of the device, and removing the capacitive windows 8 start button. As someone who delights in building and testing the latest high performance gaming rigs, I’m ashamed to admit that I am actually very impressed by the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft Claims that the Surface Pro 4 is 30% faster than the SP3, and 50% faster than the MacBook Air. While I’m inclined to believe that at least 50% of Microsoft’s boisterous claims are nothing more than preventing the truth from getting in the way of a good sales pitch, the Surface Pro 4 is undoubtedly a fast little machine. It carries twice the read/write speed of the previous generation SP3, and scores 3494 on 3D mark Skydiver and 4537 on 3D Mark Cloud Gate in my tests. According to 3DMark, this places the surface Pro 4 slightly above an office PC and below a gaming laptop. Battery was my big Surface Pro 4 letdown. As I said a little earlier, the Surface Pro 4 lasts about 7 hours if you’re both optimistic, and being Spartan with your browsing habits. Microsoft says this machine is supposed to compete directly against the MacBook Air. The MBA has a 12 hour battery life. I don’t see how the SP4 is supposed to be a viable competitor in the ultraportable sector if it can’t even make it through a full 8 hour workday of typing spreadsheets. Apparently the Surface Pro 4 has a lower battery capacity than the SP3 (allowing them to shave those all-important millimeters off the thickness), but makes up for it with the more efficient sixth gen processors. I’d rather not settle for the same battery life as the last generation. Microsoft, please fix the battery, that’d be great. Impressions If you can get your hands on one of these devices, you will be impressed by it, no matter if you’re team Apple, Team Windows, or Team Neckbeard. The magnesium case looks wonderful, and feels wonderful. I can easily hold the Surface in one hand and use it with the other, taking notes. However, I am told that as I am “freakishly tall” and a “giant,” my giant hands eschew the everyman’s surface-to-hand ratio, and that it might be considered a huge tablet. Windows 10 is snappy and responsive, once you get all the day one patches (first video games, now tablets?). The Pen is magnificent. Now that Microsoft has added a magnetic attachment point to the pen, it is much easier to use on a day to day basis, and have available for quick use. The pen also seems to be able to interpret my hieroglyphic handwriting- a major achievement, considering my English Professor couldn’t. Score for the Surface. Also working now is Windows Hello. Initially, I was skeptical of the utility and speed of what I thought was a mere gimmick. Now that I have tested Windows Hello for myself, I am thoroughly impressed, and convinced it runs on black magic, rather than a specialized camera. Hello logs me in within a second, and I love it- as long as I’m not wearing my glasses. I’m sorry sight deficient people, 20/20, Windows Hello is not for you. The type cover for the Surface Pro 4 was also a pleasant surprise. According to Microsoft, the Surface Typecover is “An essential part of the Surface experience.” (If it were essential, Microsoft, why not provide it with the tablet?) The keys have great travel, and typing on it almost feels as good as a normal notebook, though admittedly not as nice as my Cherry Blues. The backlight is a great feature for when you’re in dark area, or just too lazy to hit the light switch. Microsoft has also improved the trackpad compared to the SP3 type cover, and I’m impressed. It is much larger, smoother, and supports gestures. It’s almost even fun to use! Issues As any Apple Fan will tell you, the general rule before buying something shiny with an Apple logo is to wait for Gen 2. Both the Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4 have been plagued by launch problems. While the Surface Book is a Gen 1 device, and these issues are somewhat expected, the Surface Pro 4 is an evolution of a previous device, therefore lowering my excusability score. The SP4 has been affected by problems including: • Not being able to take photos with the rear camera • Insanely long boot times >2min • Windows Hello not working out of the box. • Flickering Screen (Related to Hyper V and the bastardized graphics driver) • Minor light bleed. I noticed only one ergonomic issue in testing the tablet. Taking a photo in portrait mode is nearly impossible. Because Microsoft positioned the Camera in the middle of the device (On both sides), and the fact that the camera app places the button on the right of the app, any attempt to take a portrait oriented photo, be it a selfie or anything else, will likely end with either your palm or fingers covering the respective camera, which is unfortunate. The best way to circumvent this is to hold the tablet one handed and poke at the camera button and pray. Not an ideal solution. All but the light bleed issue (which affects pretty much every laptop in the universe), all of the SP4’s issues seem to be software based, and Windows has been in the process of issuing updates to repair them. So far, the camera app has been patched, Windows Hello has been enabled (but you have to set up a Microsoft PIN), and according to the frequency of forum complaints, the boot times have gone down. If your device is experiencing a long boot, take off the type cover. Apparently that helps. Conclusion For someone who has a design philosophy of i7/16gb of RAM, the i5/8GB Microsoft Surface Pro 4 has impressed me greatly, and has become my day to day driver for light tasks, such as notetaking, or foreign language typing (having an adaptive touchscreen keyboard is great.) Once Microsoft finally fixes all those launch issues and optimizes the device, I’ll wholeheartedly recommend the device, if you can foot the bill.
R10JSAIRHM4DT4	5.0	Surface Pro 4 With Doc, Fantastic So Far...	15	16	Wow, reading some of the reviews here, I'm left wondering if I purchased the same device. I purchased my Surface Pro 4 from Costco the weekend it was introduced and have been extremely impressed with the device thus far. My initial concern with the model Costco sells was the I5 processor 4GB of RAM & the 128 GB storage, but the concerns about processor & RAM have yet to prove to be a limitation (I'm not a gamer but it plays the couple of games I downloaded Asphalt 8 & Modern Combat with NO ISSUES at all) . The reason I opted to buy from Costco (Love You Amazon Prime) was because, for the $1149, the unit came with the type cover, 1 Yr of Office 365 (which gets you 1TB of cloud storage), and I could buy the 3 Yr Square Trade warranty (which is awesome) for $99. I have read allot about various issues with battery drain, touch pad issues, screen flicker etc. and have to say I have had none of these. The facial recognition (which was not available upon release of the device) was updated in the 1st firmware update a couple of days after the official release. This works flawlessly, although there have been some reports that it drains the battery somewhat. That being the case I simply reverted back to the pin login, until I can confirm that any issues have been resolved. I also purchased the new dock and have it working fine with 2 Dell E2414Hr 24-Inch LED Monitors (just purchased from Amazon), printer & wireless mouse & keyboard. Windows 10 found all devices fine, and there were no driver issues. I read some reports of dual monitors not working, but after about 30 minutes of fiddling with the Windows set-up, I was able to get everything working fine (I needed to set-up one of the external monitors as primary, then extend it onto the second external monitor). One note & the pen are a wonderful addition and if you are into drawing, or note taking, then the pen (if you can hang onto it) is a refreshing tool to explore a creative outlet. I have been monitoring Microsoft's updates and they seem vigilant about getting updates out promptly to address any issues there might be. When I bought this device I thought it would be a tablet that can maybe double as a half way decent laptop, after about two weeks of use I am wondering if it can't also replace my desktop. It's an absolute breeze to carry around, and the magnetic power/docking plug seamlessly integrates with the unit making it an absolute cinch to move from office to home. The only modification I have made to the device is adding the "SmoothScroll" extension to Google Chrome. I did find the touch-pad a little clunky in Chrome. Reviews are a double edged swords where very often it is only the disgruntled that post their comments (or bogus reviews), I hope this offers a counter balance based on my experience.
RF441Y92C5OHH	5.0	Surface Pro 4 i5 is the sweet spot for Surface.	43	52	I've owned the Surface Pro 1, and the Surface Pro 3. I used my Surface Pro 1 as an all-in-one computer (except for gaming), until I got the Surface 3. Then I used my Surface 1 for teaching (on the go almost every day), and kept my Surface 3 at home as a main computer. The Surface 1 served my purposes well, and I never had a problem with it. The Surface 3 was bigger and prettier, but the computer slowed down a lot when it got hot, which meant I couldn't even watch online videos without severe drops in frame rate for that video. Between the two, I like my Surface 1 better. It seemed like the Surface 3 was trying to improve upon the original formula without actually hitting the mark. The Surface Pro 4 blows both of those away. It is what the designers wanted this thing to be. It doesn't have any of the issues that my Surface 3 had, and it runs much faster. The new type cover works very well with it (though you have to buy it separately). The native resolution of the device works very well with games it can play (only tried Hearthstone and Kentucky Route Zero), unlike the Surface 3. It seems to have good power for the price. I will use the Surface 3 for teaching now, and am going to give my Surface 1 to a friend who likes to draw and didn't like drawing pads. If you have refrained from purchasing a Surface device, now is the time to get it. I imagine the i7 versions will be faster, but the i5 is the sweet spot if you ask me. If you own a Surface 1 or 3, the upgrade is worth it. It just feels right.
R2TIPK549Z14QT	5.0	Searching for YEARS for a laptop to replace my i3 Vaio..found it!	12	13	Best laptop I ever owned..its perfection. Read that again Perfection. I have been looking several years for a new laptop. My old one Vaio E series i3 with 256 Toshiba SSD and 8 GB of Ram was getting pretty old still nice , love the ports and still serviceable almost delightful and could run anything but had terrible battery life and the keyboard was sometimes not accurate also the letters were fading on my most used keys. I even tore it apart and re applied thermal paste and cleaned out dust bunnies...I love my Vaio it was so good modern laptops looked worse. Vaio they went out of less than $1000 laptops business the Canvas costs north of $2000 now. I have played with the i5 SP4 twice in the store for hours. Compared it to the i7 Spectre 360, i7 Dell XPS 13, i 7 Vaio and even the i7 Surface Book. I kept on coming back to the i5 SP4 as the best. Something about the screen its perfect. I spent time comparing Hi resolution lots of Pluto on each screen the SP4 showed more detail. Also when used as a tablet in portrait it was a joy to read websites. So after years of searching I found the perfect device BUT the cost! I am not paying much north of $1000 for any laptop. $1200 was my top. The m3 $899 was not on display, could not even see one to see how it differed or performed. I did like hearing it was fanless and lighter. The cord bummed me out a bit as I lost a USB port. Also the cords on all models are too short compared to my Vaio. But I took the leap anyhow after four hours of playing with all the laptops in the store...$809 with my discount + teal type cover and VGA adapter + a shade above $1000 which is nearly double what I paid for my Vaio (not counting my SSD and Ram upgrades) .... but my lip swiped the card. Was it worth it ABSOLUTELY.... this device ABSOLUTELY blows my Vaio out of the water... it also seems better than my sons SP3 i5. Positives... Worth the money paid (Best laptop I ever owned) Windows as it is meant to be experienced...That sounds weird, I know but things like Gmail, Chrome and even the look of the desktop are all way better visually. Its like its all improved even though I was using the exact same OS on my Vaio. Its better. Fast, its so fast (m3) updates are instantaneous and Windows Hello is so fast too. Silence absolute silence! The keyboard, pen etc are amazing...teal is perfect. It looks black at night and a nice teal by day. Very nice yet understated. Just the way I like it. So let me summarize..its worth $1000 and the m3 is fine for 99.99% of users and has its own benefits (lighter and silence) You will not be dissappointed in the m3 at all..my advice its the best laptop out there regardless of cost. Best screen, fanlesss...awesomeness. Also the SP4 is stable for touch , most laptops wobbled when touched not the SP4 rock solid no wobble at all Micro SD card up to any spec...for extra storage. Now the negatives... I get it $1000 is a lot of money so I will list that as a 'negative" but not in the context of the best laptop on the planet. Its perfect in that regard its a bargain that you did not waste money on other. Cord is too short! Lap-ability is not as good as my Vaio from a comfort standpoint but it runs cooler so almost a wash Hope this review helps, i know computers and build desktops... this SP4 is perfection embodied. its a mature 4th gen with 6th gen windows 10 reference device... no compromises...just awesome.
R2W9PGZ586SBVO	2.0	Why I returned my SP4	11	12	Seems like they should have waited another month or two before releasing this into the wild. Overall, it's an excellently crafted piece of hardware, but it has a lot of minor bugs that lead to me returning it - because for $1200 after keyboard and taxes, I expected a tablet that works next to flawlessly. It has a lot of issues waking up, I found online that many users have to press a button on the keyboard to exit sleeping. It has a lot of issues with Chrome - although this may be Chrome's fault - but Hangouts won't dock on the bottom bar, and if you alternate between touch and mouse, your mouse will disappear and won't come back until you restart the unit. Onenote2016 - the built in software that you are stuck with when you push the eraser in - has a lot of issues. The first thing I did was spend a few hours drawing diagrams for a table I was building, and the next time I opened it, every diagram I had drawn was missing pieces, some small, some massive (50% of a diagram was MIA, just random pieces erased). From what I gathered, this is some issue that it's had for a while with text processing, no fix from MS. I had a couple hardware issues - the pen's Cortana button didn't work, and the charger's USB port didn't work. Beyond these issues, the hardware is very well done and I expect this will be an awesome product after(/if) they iron the kinks out, but for now it has a lot of small bugs that make it not worth keeping for me.
R190PDDCTN47O2	3.0	Microsoft created a great product...but they should have fixed the bugs before releasing it	14	16	I've been playing around with the SP4 for a couple weeks, and have decided to keep it as my primary computer. THAT BEING SAID, this is typical Microsoft, where they had a deadline and released a buggy product because they could... SP4, I5, 16gb of RAM, 256gb hard drive, Touch keyboard with fingerprint scanner, ordered directly from Microsoft. For the good, I really like this tablet. I love the fingerprint sensor on the keyboard. The battery life is good enough, and overall it's a good experience. Now for the bugs: 1. Sometimes when it goes to sleep it won't wake up and you have to restart. 2. Sometimes the keyboard won't work. Restart required. 3. Sometimes the touch screen would just die. Restart required. 4. One time I came back to it and the fan was running full speed even though it was off. 5. Auto-brightness seems a little finicky. Will initially be too dim, then when you give up and brighten it yourself, it will go significantly brighter, and you have to dim it again...then it settles down. 6. A little slow to wake up, so you are wondering if it's going to require a restart. I've downloaded firmware updates from Microsoft's website, and the experience is improving and the bugs seem to be going away...but they should have just fixed the thing before releasing. Hence a 3 star rating instead of a 4.5 which is what it deserves when it is working right.
R2OHPWACK9L4KV	3.0	Almost there...if you can wait, then wait!	29	36	**Disclaimer - This is all in my own opinion and you are free to disagree with it as I am free to voice it. I have only used this tablet for a week and I am returning it. I know a week isn't ideal, so keep that in mind with this review. After reading some other reviews, I wonder if I just got a bad device :(** TL;DR (Summary) - The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 does seem to make improvements in nearly all aspects from the Surface Pro 3. It is a beautiful piece of machinery that is unfortunately held down by a very buggy piece of Windows 10 and minor, but questionable hardware issues that probably only bother me or those who are picky about their electronics. That being said, I feel like the model I received was hastily made. I have to keep pushing in rubber stoppings around the power button/volume button (like many others have said in tech forums.), the screen bends/bows very easily when written on (a solid quarter inch up and down when pushed on), and the pen buttons seem to behave abnormally (though that might be a software issue?). However, what killed it for me, was the amount of crashing and programs that didn't open properly. Any PDF annotating I did, wouldn't save when using Adobe, Drawboard PDF, and other programs. OneNote has a hard time opening, both the Win10 version and the 2016 version. If they do open, then they work for about 15 minutes or so. After that, the screen flashes and half of your stuff is gone. Restarting the Surface is a necessity when it comes out of sleep mode at this point and time for it operate as intended. Attaching/detaching the Type Cover for Surface Pro 4 is amazingly simple, but the mouse cursor would disappear or the type cover would never properly type. It's as if the Surface Pro 4 would not recognize the type cover until after a restart. For the tech enthusiast who can deal with buggy software/know how to comfortably work around issues in Windows 10, then this tablet is impressive and probably for you if you are apart of the niche market that Microsoft is aiming for in their Surface Pro line. For pretty much everyone else, I would just wait. I have no doubt that this machine will get better with time. It seems like the manufacturing company had to hastily put together these machines to meet the outstanding demand. The fact that Microsoft had to push Day 1 updates and nearly daily updates makes me wonder if the Surface was truly ready to be released. HOWEVER. I am glad to see Microsoft pushing updates at the speed they are doing. The company that Microsoft is turning into is a great one that seems to listen to it's consumers. I know I will end up buying this tablet, but as of now there are numerous kinks that need to be worked out software wise (Windows 10) and Microsoft needs to keep an eye on quality assurance coming from whichever manufacturer they are using.
R2AUCIGYPB02W1	1.0	tons of issues like BSOD, driver crashing	23	28	Amazon threatened me stopping my Amazon account after returning 2 of defective units, tons of issues like BSOD, driver crashing, loose casing, poor battery life, dead/hot pixels excessive right bleed and etc. the s***ty quality of this product is not Amazon's fault but I guess I have to stop purchasing MS product from Amazon at least. I love the idea of the product and have owned SP3 that was already sold for 4. It's a shame MS screwed up the launch of this product so bad.. If you are on the fense of ordering it. I recommend wait for a few months until all the issues are ironed out.
R3SYIC3UFV2327	5.0	Lightweight, Fast, And Fun	10	11	I got this recently as a replacement for my laptop. My laptop was actually working fine, but it was bulky and heavy. I wanted something lightweight that had the ability to act as a regular Windows computer. I was going to get the Surface Pro 3, but then I decided to wait a few months for the Surface Pro 4. I'm glad I did. I actually really love this computer despite the hiccups at launch (I got mine on the day it was released). I haven't been this excited about a new piece of tech since I got my very first iPhone almost 10 years ago. To be honest, the Surface is what I wish the iPad had been - a powerful computer that would lighten the load on my backpack when I'm traveling. However the iPad was extremely hard to be productive on, and it ended up sitting on my shelf collecting dust. After a few initial bugs (which have mostly been ironed out by Microsoft) I'm happy to say that the Surface is extremely fun to use, fast, and has all the flexibility that a normal PC has. The display is simply beautiful - the contrast, color, and clarity of the screen is amazing. It's quite the luxury after my washed out laptop screen. The pen is a nice accessory although I will be honest that I haven't found much use for it beyond doing the New York Times crossword puzzle (which is actually strangely satisfying when using the pen). They keyboard cover is lightweight enough to not add too much to the tablet, and the feel is great for quick typists like myself. I will say that the Surface is not without some lingering bugs. I have faith that Microsoft will get these sorted, but they aren't deal breakers by any means (at least for myself). The worst is that sometimes the computer doesn't go into or out of sleep mode properly. However until that's fixed I will just shut down the computer when leaving it for long periods of time....it really only takes a few seconds longer. The only other thing is battery life - it knocks the pants off my old laptop's measly 1.5 hours of battery life. However, it's not quite the 9 hours or so that was advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours of real world usage. Overall if you're looking for something lightweight that has the power and flexibility of a full Windows rig, look no further.
R1F9OSD6FHT7L4	5.0	Replaces laptop + iPad for School	12	14	I am very happy with its performance. The integration of OneNote and OneDrive have made it a wonderful class note taking machine, and the screen is crisp and unparalleled, the updated type cover has smooth glass-like touchpad, and the keys are crunchy and responsive. The typecover is an awesome addition (even though it is an extra $130), and the ability to have the touchscreen, pen, and touchpad make any kind of word processing and editing a breeze. I especially like the double-click screen shot and it is incredibly handy to be able to take notes directly on uploaded powerpoint slides, as well as use the screen cap - double click with the pen to take shots from Khan Academy videos and anatomy websites. Although I would have preferred the surface book (for roughly the same functionality - use it mostly like a computer and sometimes as a tablet) I needed a computer now (old one was dying) and this came on time and in perfect working condition, and only took a minimum amount of time to set up and get to work. Even though it's a little pricey for the midline model (I paid roughly $1350 including typecover and mouse) it is replacing my $400 iPad and $1,100 laptop. Highly recommend if you are looking for a powerful tablet that you can still work on. Highly recommend!
RL47WXK3AQAL	2.0	Defective unit?	9	10	I was extremely excited to get my hands on a SP4. I've only owned mine for 3 days at the tone of this review but I've had many problems already. So far it has crashed on me twice while taking pictures in the One Note app, 3 different times it wouldn't wake from sleep and I had yo do hard restarts, and now 2 times "touch" stopped working and I had to restart to regain touch functions. Also Cortana would not pick up my voice one time which I also had to restart to correct. I hate writing a bad review for something I wanted so badly, but it seems Microsoft has a bunch of kinks that they didn't bother ironing out... Maybe my unit is just defective. I will update if I send in for a replacement.
R32YHOQZIVPXYK	4.0	Pros and cons for you to review before purchase	5	5	I purchased my Surface Pro 4 to replace an ASUS Taichi laptop/tablet so I'd been using a tablet almost exclusively for 2-1/2 years prior to getting my Surface Pro. I was immediately struck by the build quality of this tablet. It is a surprisingly solid computer despite how thin and light it is. There are a lot of things to like about the product and a few things that are problems. I will try to hit pros and cons here to help you in making your own purchase decision. First up, the pros: - Lightweight - I have problems using my hands and holding onto things but this tablet is so light I can easily carry it around in one hand. - Seems solidly built. The back of the tablet is metal. - Barely gets warm to the touch. This surprised me. There is fan inside this unit (must be TINY) and it will run usually when the battery is charging or if the CPU is under heavy load - like when you are doing something graphics intensive. But even when it isn't running (or is running so low that I can't hear it) the unit doesn't get overly warm. Good since you are holding onto this thing a lot. - Everything is magnetic. The pen has a fairly strong magnet in it so you can store it on the left side of the tablet. The power connector is also magnetic and "clicks" into place in either alignment (up or down). Of course there are also some fairly strong magnets in the base to hold the optional cover in place (which I did NOT purchase). Those magnets are strong enough that they will grab my stylus if I set it down in front of my tablet. - The pen is nice to use. The nib on the end "feels" good when you use it to write. It isn't too hard or soft and can be set to how sensitive it is. I have a very heavy hand and was pleased to see that I could back off the sensitivity a bit so I could write better with the pen. The eraser on the top is also a cool touch. Looking up things on Wikipedia is easy now - use the eraser to delete your entry in the Search bar and then write (in your own hand) a new search item in the box at the bottom of the screen. It recognized my sloppy writing easily so the character recognition built in must be fairly good. - The power supply has a built in USB charger on it. Most people probably haven't even noticed it is there but I thought that was a nice touch so I can charge something right from the brick if I want to. - i5 is plenty fast. My ASUS Taichi has an i7 processor and I was worried this might be underpowered. It isn't. In fact, I would say that the new Skylake chip is faster than my old i7. Don't let the fact that this is a dual-core processor lead you to believe this is going to be a slow machine. Most processors created for mobile use are dual-core anyway because they use less power. This is Intel's 6th generation chip so you can believe they have made good advances in optimizing this processor's speed. - Battery life is mostly good. So I can get a LOT more usage out of this machine than I ever could my Taichi. But in point of fact, YMMV depending on what you use your tablet for. I have gotten as much as 8 hours out my battery when I'm just sitting and reading the news or looking at email. I have also gotten as little as 2 hours out of it while playing a game. So don't let the specs fool you - this is truly dependent on what you use your device for. I stream video from my NAS to my tablet and I can watch for around 5 to 6 hours before I have to plug in for a charge. Decide for yourself if that is good. Since my old Taichi barely ran for 2 hours on battery, I'm pleased. - The screen is nice (mostly). The hardware in the screen is good and I think once the drivers get better I will be able to say this looks "beautiful." But see my Cons list below for more on this. - Sound is surprisingly clear and expansive. So tiny little speakers are never going to blow you away. But I'm surprised at how clear the sound it coming through these speakers. It's got good definition and is adequate for when you want to share a quick video or sound clip with those around you. Just don't expect massive amounts of bass from these tiny speakers. Use headphones when you want to hear more. Next up, the cons: - Touchpad built for the pen, NOT for a stylus. I prefer to use a stylus when navigating and not use the pen ALL the time. But I think Microsoft would prefer you use the stylus for everything. Why? Because the experience using a stylus is mediocre at best. Many times you have to press much too hard to input a command. And many times I have trouble even starting a program with my stylus - having to press is several times just to get it going. With the pen, everything works on first touch. The pen is set up to input or to be used to write but NOT to navigate around. So I'm struggling a bit getting used to just how I'm supposed to navigate while having to switch back and forth between my pen and my stylus. It can be frustrating when it really shouldn't be so. - Drivers (especially the video driver) are wonky for now. So I think this will get resolved in future updates, but right now there are problems. The video in this is the new Intel HD 520 built for use on the new Skylake processor. By-and-large, it works OK. But I have seen frequent video card driver "not responding" messages while using both Edge and Firefox. When there are a lot of items on a web page, it seems the new video card driver cannot handle them and either shuts down briefly or resets. Every time this has happened to me, the video driver has recovered almost immediately. But this is annoying and I'm hoping a fix will be issued soon. - Touchscreen can be flaky. I have only encountered the "touchscreen not working" error once and it was during a graphics-intensive game. I had to get my Bluetooth keyboard and use it to restart the tablet. I'm guessing this is another driver problem but can't say for sure just yet. I also have problems with how the touchscreen interprets my inputs. For example, there are many times when I want to use a menu item in the upper-left corner but instead of inputting my command, the screen will shift to the Select Program (like Alt+Tab) view. Sometimes this will also happen in one of the other corners and instead of doing what I ask, I will be presented with one of the sliding menus from the right side of the screen. I haven't been able to figure out how to change settings for this (and I HAVE tried a few times) so I think this also needs to be fixed in the driver. - Various other visual glitches. Again, the video card driver is likely to blame, but there are many times when I am scrolling down a web page or document and you can visually see the background color change from white-ish to more red-ish or blue-ish depending on what comes up on the screen. It makes you think your eyes are going batty and it's annoying. I have also seen programs (like Sudoku) start out somewhat blurry before gradually becoming more clear and crisp. Not a huge problem but something that makes you think you are seeing things. Definitely need to fix this video card driver. Items that could go either way: - The kickstand. So I really like the kickstand. It is REALLY stiff to move and stays put when you set it in the position you want. But I could see how some folks might not like it. Personally, I think having it this stiff is a must otherwise your tablet might fall over. My only concern is how will it hold up over time. I hope to be using this tablet for years so I hope it stays this stiff for the life of the tablet. - Windows 10 itself. I personally like Windows 10 and I think it was an improvement over both Windows 7 and 8.x. I do NOT like all the privacy problems with the OS and I do not like the fact that MS has taken back some control over which updates you can install. But I do think that the Surface Pro is the right device to run this OS. Love it or hate it, Windows 10 works well on a touch device and I think MS got it right when they built the Surface Pro line. Overall I like my Surface Pro 4 and would easily purchase it again. It absolutely does what I need it to do - it's fast, lightweight, and mostly durable. I would recommend you get yourself a nice screen cover or carrying case because having all that glass out in the open all the time could be a problem (I am replacing my ASUS Taichi with this unit because the screen on my Taichi got cracked when the power supply was dropped on the edge of its touchscreen. Do yourself a favor and protect your investment with a cover or sleeve.)
RC81IC1OYUEEI	5.0	Setup was breeze, everything working fine	11	13	I received my SP4 I5 256Gb today and setup was a breeze, including Windows Update. Everything working, including cameras and the beautiful display. I like the keyboard tactile response and backlighting. Took my time installing apps and verified operation after each install. More to install, but so far the installs have been completely painless. Expensive machine, but so far it appears to be (almost) worth the price.
R1PPFPVUJ3K0E5	5.0	Will replace my business laptop	8	9	I am and IT professional and got a Surface Pro 4 for testing. After using it for one day, I have decided to ditch my laptop and switch to the surface. It does everything that I need and I love using the stylus with OneNote. Windows Hello works as I expected and makes signing on seamless while eliminating the need to use passwords. I use LastPass to manage all my browser passwords, so that makes using the device in tablet mode without a keyboard so much easier.
R3COTAOCRCW7BW	2.0	Why I returned the SP4	18	23	I used the device for a little more than 1 week. Here are the reasons why I returned my Surface Pro 4: 1- The screen bends during normal stylus use, this might be normal but it feels like it might eventually damage it. Also the screen gets quite hot and you can feel it when you rest your palm on it, even with light usage. 2- The hinge is a bit "slack" and wobbles, which is not normal for a product of that price. 3- The display kept crashing even after all the updates installed. I am assuming that this is a problem that will be fixed in the future but it was very frustrating. 4- When using the stylus, the cursor gets slow at the edges of the screen which is very abnormal. This is also very frustrating since I bought this tablet principally to use it as a note taking device. 5- The battery life is very poor, even with "Performance Options" set to "Adjust for best performance" and with minimum brightness I could get no more than 5h of battery life.
RH847VNSGFBVV	5.0	This is a product that I can recommend without even thinking twice	7	8	I bought this from the MS online store and I have wanted to leave a review for anyone who wishes to buy this. First, let me give you a brief idea of what I was looking for in a machine: 1. Not a lot of horsepower (I have a Xeon enabled desktop at work, need I say more?) but enough so that watching YouTube/Netflix/music while doing word processing or presentations or reading articles doesn't cause hiccups - conclusion was that I need i5 and 8 GB RAM 2. Excellent screen (I had a really poor quality screen on my 4 year old XPS) so that articles, documents, presentations, videos, etc. shine to their maximum capacity - conclusion was that I would need something with great color reproduction and high DPI 3. Light note-taking on PDF files, presentations, meetings, etc. - conclusion was that I would need a pen-enabled system 4. Portable so that I don't need to lug around anything more than 2.5 kgs INCLUDING charging cords - conclusion was that I would need a thin machine 5. I should be able to integrate the new machine with my Xbox One system at home - conclusion was that I would need something with Windows 10 6. Exceptional support - conclusion was that I would need a good reputed company logo on my machine Based on these requirements, I set my sight on a few machines: Lenovo Yoga, Dell XPS 12 and obviously the Surface i5. As you would imagine, the Surface came out on top on almost everything barring the battery life (6 hours of video is enough for me) and the keyboard design (I don't plan on doing any of my heavy duty typing on the type cover in any case). So I went ahead and took the plunge expecting some minor hiccups but an overall nice experience. And boy was I surprised. The machine was delivered the day it was launched and the packaging was top notch (showed that the company cared for all round look and feel of the device experience rather than just the device itself). After doing the mandatory day one updates (I don't really see the issue with this considering the internet speeds we have these days), I saw I was having a small issue with the rear camera - I contacted support and they said that it was a known issue and the camera app was updated less than a day later and voilà, it was working like a charm. Other than that single hiccup, everything has been an awesome experience.
R34CWN6ZJFD5PE	5.0	From a First Time Surface User	5	6	I hesitated big time to spend this much money on a tablet/laptop. I seriously was not sure that a $600 laptop would work for me just fine. My thoughts after using the SP4 for a short time? I like it very much! Here are the pros/cons - from a first time Surface user: 1) It is super fast (I have the 128GB 4GB Ram, i5). This morning I turned it on and was checking email online in 10 or 15 seconds. All the programs so far are very responsive for me. The internet works fine, and it connected to my work printer quickly and easily. 2) It is quite user friendly. I've only used Windows 10 on a different laptop for a month or so, and now using this SP4 is easy. I'm not a super-fan of Microsoft, but I'm not disappointed with Windows 10 on this SP4. 3) It is very portable. With the Microsoft Keyboard and a nice hard case, the SP4 looks sleek and is easy to carry around and use (note: it isn't ideal to type while the unit is on your lap). 4) The pen is awesome. The eraser works great, and the painting and note apps are sweet. The way it is held magnetically to the tablet or keyboard is slick as well. 5) All my plug and play hardware worked flawlessly (from a wireless USB mouse to a USB hub/converter for a different screen). CONS: 1) Microsoft's apps suck. I know this isn't specifically related to the SP4, but the email app isn't great, and there aren't a lot of other excellent apps. (I have heard you can get an android emulator for the SP, FYI). 2) The battery is just average - I wouldn't call it horrible, and I didn't expect it to last a super long time, but it's just average. 3) I did have an issue that a few apps wouldn't open (e.g. mail and my Bible software program). I had to google it and found a fix after about 30 minutes. Not the end of the world, but a little frustrating. It all works fine now, FYI. 4) The keyboard isn't included in the price. You have to buy it separately. I knew that from the get go so it wasn't a surprise, but I think it's pretty dumb to have to buy a keyboard separately. In case you're wondering, there is a fan on this unit - but it's not too loud. Also, I purchased mine from the Microsoft website, and it comes with a one year warranty. Anyway, I could go on, but all this to say: I'm impressed, and so far I really like my SP4. It's perfect for my studies, writing, internet use, music listening, and a few extras. The price is up there, but if it lasts for me, I'd say it is worth it.
R32QQLA84MC4QX	4.0	Surface Pro 4: It's what you're (Possibly) looking for	5	6	So I was going to give myself a week before I made this review, just so I let Microsoft catch up on their updates a bit. Is the surface pro 4 made to be both a tablet and a laptop? To me, that answer is yes. While a kickstand is not something everyone prefers on their lap, I find it somewhat easy to do work on it, whether it be on my lap or on the desk. I will start with what I like about it so far. Pros: -It's lightweight -The type cover, while an obligatory investment if you really want to do any real writing, is well improved over the previous type covers, and the keyboard is very responsive in comparison to the piece of crap type cover 2. I cannot say anything on comparison between the 3 & 4 as I did not own a 3. -The pen is very easy to use, and it doesn't feel like you're bashing the screen with the end of it. I hadn't used the pen much prior to this, as I had a Surface Pro 2. However, I find it very easy to use in the case I want to draw something to illustrate, or write down notes in my OneNote. -It is fast, and I enjoy the fact I can now run multiple desktops on one device in Windows. Something Mac OS (And Linux-based systems, of course), have always beat windows on. -It is a workhorse. I can do things on this more smoothly than my work computer (A Dell). I think the only thing my work computer has on this one is it beats battery life. -Windows Hello. Meaning Facial recognition. Pretty accurate stuff. They did a couple tests with it, and windows hello could tell the difference between identical twins. Well done. -It is touch screen. Kinda nice to have when you have floor maps and can move around them easily -I have not had any compatibility issues with the majority of my programs with the exception of a few (Listed below). I have a feeling this will be fixed in the near future. As for the cons, there is still a moderate list, and the reason I gave a four star review (For the time being). Here is my cons based on experience: Cons: -Battery life sucks. 9 hours Microsoft? More like 4.5 on default settings. If you adjust brightness to maybe 35% (Default 50) it does help, along with running battery saver and controlling certain programs from opening at startup. The fact I have to do all of this just to pump it up to 6-7 hours though is disappointing. -There are certain Windows 10/software-specific issues I'd like to address. Read below. -One USB 3.0 port. While I don't use a bunch of USB for my everyday usage, having at least two would be nice. One for my USB drive, one for my wireless mouse. -Some programs I've noticed have a problem with window sizing. If you want to know what I mean, download the Kindle app. -More of a Windows thing. Still no native SSH client. Get with the program, Microsoft! -Tablet mode does not work properly. More so, Windows 10 does not have the built-in functionality for it (Yet. I'm counting on you, Microsoft). Software Issues: -Visio 2016 does not work. Don't try installing it. -This may just require additional investigation, but I have yet to get Python 3.4 to work completely. That is, installing modules with pip. -Random popping noise on speakers. I've only heard it once, but it's been reported numerous times. -I have not heard anyone report this one yet, but I will say it here. I have both 2.4 and 5 GHz running on my home router. No problems with 2.4, but for some reason 5 GHz is intermittent on connectivity when I use the Surface Pro, and this issue has not gotten better since the recent firmware update FYI. I have a few other devices in my home environment running without issues, all on 5 GHz. -Again, the window sizing on certain programs is clunky. I have to manually adjust window size on some programs for optimal usage. -Battery drain. Putting your surface pro in sleep STILL drains battery. After all this time, and Microsoft still hasn't addressed that problem. My recommendation: Set power settings to hibernate whenever closing the lid or pushing the power button if you want to save your battery life. Some programs I run: Office 365, Putty, VLC, GNS3, Vsphere Client, OneNote, Firefox, Wireshark and various network analysis tools, Itunes, Skype, OpenVPN. Recommendations for Peripherals: SInce I know many people have most likely seen the ridiculous pricing of the new "Surface Dock", and many of you probably have seen the poor initial reviews, I have provided my own recommendation of current peripherals I own that are not only cheap, but retain their quality with this device. I am not sure what your purpose is with the dock, but I see most people complaining about the lack of multiple usb ports and an ethernet port. -Hootoo USB 3.0 Hub: You can find this on amazon for a little over 20 bucks, and it includes three USB 3.0 ports with a Gigabit Ethernet adapter. I recommend installing the Windows 8.1 drivers, otherwise you may have issues with your wireless mice/keyboards. -AmazonBasics Wireless mouse (~$12): While Microsoft's mouse does look fancy, I prefer one that works in the majority of environments while keeping cost down. This is what I use. -Samsung 64 GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC (~$20): For SD storage. -AmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to HDMI Adapter (~$10): For HDMI port in case your monitor uses HDMI. The final verdict: Would I recommend this product to someone if they're looking for a nice student/business solution? The answer is it depends on you, but without a doubt it is a great device with a few initial issues. My recommendation is wait a month or two and allow Microsoft to make its fixes before diving in. If you don't mind what was stated above, go for it.
R3O3V8ZNTL3V1T	4.0	They works great when it's working right	5	6	We bought 3 for the Office fully loaded with additional warranty. They works great when it's working right. Right of the bat, I had seen several issues. One of my SP4 doesn't work with the Surface Dock to display to 2 external monitors. (Confirmed that the other 2 SP4 works just fine) Microsoft support is not that helpful. After talking to my re-seller, I'm going to try to exchange it to the MS.Store and see how the process go When you have your type cover folded back (table stand/docking style), you can't turn on the Surface. You'll get stuck at Surface logo. You have to fold the type cover like the laptop style to start the Surface first before folding it back to put on your cubicle. As of 11/16 with latest Update, this bug still has not been fixed. There are random major slowdown at times that's highly unusual with laptop with SSD. I'm still not able to pinpoint what cause it. I suspect either keyboard/touchscreen/input issue or network drives issues, since our SP4 is connected to the domain. Windows Hello is great when it's working, it works about 80% of the time. At times, I noticed that if your camera is angled up against the ceiling light, it has issue with windows hello recognition. Surface Pen, I don't really find any real business usage for the pen. Yeah it's neat to have, but I don't use them enough.. For almost $2,000 (touch cover, dock, 4yrs warranty) we spent for each machine it's kind of unacceptable. At the end of the days, for regular user, if you have no need for the pen, I would go with an Ultrabook for about $700, compared to spending close to $2000 for this machine.
RXBJ6O2U4GP9B	5.0	Upgraded from a Surface 3...love it	5	6	I'm a long-time Surface user beginning with the 2 and recently the 3. Debated quite a bit before buying the 4. Totally sold: - Screen is awesome and you'll notice there are no visual pixels like with the 2 and 3 even when up close. - The pen had mix reviews, but it is totally a better experience than the 3. The tip slows your writing just a bit and my writing looks just like paper. - The bump in processor speed over my i5 3 is awesome. Couldn't believe how much faster browsing and other functions were. My only gripe is the auto brightness. Flickers at low levels and bothered my eyes. A bit of a pain, but I adjust to 25, 50, 75 or 100%. When I'm taking notes in a darker room I have to adjust manually. I bought this from a Microsoft Store and did have a problem with the first one. It bricked after a Windows Update. Took it back and got a new one in a box. Second one is terrific.
R36OQZVSQ7O465	2.0	I advise to wait,	3	3	A product is judged by its highest standards. When a consumer compromises he is only to blame. I returned my first unit because it became unresponsive. It also had noticbale quality issues; wobbling when opened, some light bleed. No need to reiterate the software issues. I will not buy again until Microsoft fixes all the issues to an acceptable level. I will buy it, but not until it is to my purchasing standards. Patiently waiting to buy the Surface Pro 4 at the right time, but not now.
R8U17D4YI2UQA	3.0	Surface Pro 4 vs Surface Pro 2	2	2	I have used Windows almost exclusively for the past 2 decades. I was excited when they launched the Surface line of tablets, and bought in with a Surface Pro 2, so that will mostly be my base of comparison for the Surface Pro 4. I haven't used a Surface Book, nor have any interest in comparing this product to one. My Surface Pro 4 is an i5, 512 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM model. I will get this out of the way...I have been rather disappointed in the battery life so far. Although Microsoft has packed a lot into a small package, it doesn't, or cannot compare, with the battery life of an iPad. If you are interested in a tablet for general web browsing, then this is not for you. Besides being far more expensive (also understanding that Intel is having trouble with it's video drivers and Windows 10 doesn't have all the bugs ironed out yet), my Surface Pro 2 with the battery-pack keyboard running Windows 10 could outlast this device. Based on hardware specs, the newer Surface Pro 4 is a noticeable jump in technology from the Surface Pro 2. Programs run much smoother on the newest implementation of Intel's processor (Skylake). The pen is much larger, providing a better fit in your hand, and the palm-block technology and pressure-sensitivity make this a great device to take notes on. I also like the fact that there's no dedicated magnetic holder for the pen. On the Surface Pro 2, the charging port doubled as the magnetic pen holder, which I never used for fear of losing the pen. On the Surface Pro 4, the pen just kind of sticks magnetically to the left of the tablet (with keyboard attached, in "laptop mode"), and it is surprisingly sturdy. The display is large, gorgeous, and has great viewing angles; with that said, I have had the same screen-flicker problems that many, if not all, of the devices are shipping with right now. I mostly notice the flicker at lower screen brightness (25%), but it seems to go away if I bump it up to 50%. At 100% the device is extremely bright and in my opinion, it makes the device suitable for use in direct sunlight, such as an airport bay window, but it's way too much for indoors use. I did purchase the keyboard with the fingerprint scanner, because I was confused about whether the camera was Windows Hello compatible. I think Microsoft could have done a much better job providing this information in the run-up to the launch. Well... the camera IS compatible with Windows Hello, and it's an awesome and much welcomed addition to Windows. It works extremely well, whether you have facial hair or not, are wearing a hat or not, or are wanting to log into your tablet in an almost completely dark room... the camera WILL recognize you. I probably won't be using the fingerprint scanner for very much, which is kind of a bummer (an extra $30 over the regular keyboard). Upgrading from the Surface Pro 2, this keyboard definitely blows the old one out of the water, everything from the tactile feedback and the chiclet-style spacing of the keys, to the large glass trackpad that you can actually use gestures on. The trackpad on the Surface Pro 2 was about half as large and had the same felt-like feel as the material the rest of the keyboard was made from, making it a chore to use. The newer version of the keyboard is also backlit, which is an improvement over the Surface Pro 2's battery-pack keyboard. The device ships with an immature Windows 10 as an OS. I upgraded all of my devices to Windows 10 shortly after the launch in October. It hasn't been a smooth transition, and I've seen some odd behavior on the Surface Pro 4 as well. I have had the display driver recover itself, resulting in the screen flickering for an instant and freezing up the tablet in the process. I've also had one BSOD, or whatever you want to call it in the newer versions of the OS. Windows 10 needs improvement from a stability standpoint, and I'm afraid that with Microsoft's promised rate of updates, this could be a disaster. I'd prefer stability over features at this point. I haven't had a problem with the WiFi, which is a great improvement over the Surface Pro 2. Although it happened less frequently with Windows 10, sometimes the Surface Pro 2 would boot and WiFi wouldn't be available. A reboot would always solve the problem, but it was a hassle. I haven't seen this problem yet with the Surface Pro 4. I have also used the WiFi Direct feature with my Samsung TV, and it works without a hitch. Compared to the Surface Pro 2, all of the buttons and ports are swapped, and the volume buttons no longer reside on the side of the device. So the power button has been relocated to the top left of the device (with keyboard attached), and volume buttons are right next to the power button. I'm sure eventually I will train myself, but for now it makes it a hassle to remember which is volume up and which is volume down, if I don't hit the power button. The USB and mini-display ports are on the right of the tablet (with keyboard attached), as well as the charging port. No Type-C USB, but that's ok with me. I was a big fan of the microSD card slot on the Surface Pro 2, and I'm glad it carried over to the Surface Pro 4. It's nice having a slot for an extra 128 GB of storage. The Surface Pro 4 with keyboard is a lot lighter than the Surface Pro 2. This wasn't really a purchasing decision for me, but may be for someone else. The thinner design of the newer tablet does help when holding it in tablet mode. The Surface Pro 4 seems more efficient as far as heat generation goes. The Surface Pro 2 could get pretty hot, making it uncomfortable to hold. Due to the larger design of the Surface Pro 4, the heat generation takes place in the upper part of the screen, so as not to bother me too much while holding it in tablet mode. The Surface Pro 4 also stays cooler longer, but... when the fan kicks in, it is quite noticeable. I wouldn't say loud, but you can definitely hear it, and it's louder than the fan on my Surface Pro 2. All in all, this a good device with an OK OS. It has much potential, but it remains to be seen whether or not Microsoft can reach that potential. I would like to see more improvements in the OS, as well as battery-life improvements. I've always been a fan of Windows, and Windows 10 is a step in the right direction from a design standpoint, but lacks the stability of a more mature Windows 8/8.1. I don't think this is the device that will thrust Microsoft ahead of Apple in consumer opinion/satisfaction due to the amount of problems at launch, and if you're on the cusp about whether or not to purchase the device, I would wait a few months to see what Microsoft does. I will try to keep this review updated. ***Update 1 (11/18/15)*** Ok, so after using the Surface Pro 4 as my primary computer for the past couple of weeks, here's what I've learned: 1) Battery life is still an issue. General web browsing, you can expect 4-5 hrs of battery life. Hardly the "all day" power Microsoft claims, and nowhere near the 9 hrs of video playback Microsoft also promised. 2) Screen flicker is also a problem, even after the firmware update on 11/2/15 that was supposed to correct the issue. 3) Video driver still crashes. 4) Windows 10 Fall Update provided some new features and added some stability to the OS (especially with Edge browser, which still lacks browser extensions). 5) I haven't had the Wi-Fi problems others are complaining about. That has been a strong feature of the tablet so far. 6) I still maintain my 3 star rating.
R3CT3PT17QYY9Y	5.0	Processor specs	5	6	This one's for all those prospective buyers who are curious about the processor. Microsoft Surface Pro 4, Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD uses a Core i5-6300u. It is a dual core processor with hyperthreading (for a total of four logical cores), clocked at 2.4 GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3 GHz.
RW8A25AZS5O89	4.0	Terrific device! Dissapointed with dimensions and weight, though	13	18	I am writing this review within 12 hours of setting my hands on the device for the first time. I will split my review by topics, to make it easier for other people to get the info that they need: 1. Unboxing: Best unboxing ever! I have never bought another piece of Microsoft hardware before, so I cannot compare with other of their products, but comparing it to products from Apple or Anker (which for me are at the top of boxing/packing/presentation charts), I must say that this is the best of the best. Style-wise, I would give it a 4/5. But in regards to how easy to open it was, the design to maximize the space without compromising security of the device, intuitive placement of devices and literature, etc., they have a full 5/5!!! First time that I have not needed scissors, a knife or any other tool other than my fingers to get to my tech device; no need to use my nails either. Microsoft hit it out of the park with this one. 2. Dimensions, weight: I was disappointed with the dimensions and weight. BTW, this is the reason for the dropped star in my overall rating. I know that in order to be a "tablet that will replace your laptop", things like dimensions and weight must be compromised, but it is way heavier and bigger than I expected. I have been using iPads and Android tablets for years, so I think that I am still with the "tablet" idea, not a tablet on steroids. When I hold the Surface for the first time, I literally said to the person next to me: "If I knew that this was this big and heavy, I would have not bought it." 3. Looks: Stunning! Beautiful big display, bright, and superb resolution, feels solid. 4. Accessories: I purchased the keyboard too, and the magnetic connection is solid. When it snaps, you feel like that it will never get disconnected from the Surface. Typing on the keyboard is great. It somehow has a feel of a mechanical keyboard. I have not used the trackpad yet, though. I am so into the pen that I even forgot that there was a trackpad in the keyboard. The pen looks awesome, feels great, its response time is terrific, perfect weight, nice functionalities. Pairing it with the Surface was almost automatic and occurred in half a second; very impressed with that! The magnetic holder of the pen on one of the sides of the Surface can be greatly improved. It works very well when you are using the Surface on a desk, but you will instantly hate it when storing your Surface in a sleeve, bag, or even while using it on your lap. 5. Performance: Lightning speed!!! Compared with my desktop computer, which has better hardware specs than the Surface, I must say that this little guy is a contender. Recently, I reformatted my desktop computer and loaded Windows 10, so I compared the Surface setup/loading experience with what I experienced with my desktop - I must say that the setup, loading of programs, applying additional updates, etc., was way smoother and faster on the Surface. I am super pleased with that, and impressed. I have even added and ran several virtual machines on the Surface, and man, I AM SHOCKED. I may update my review in a couple weeks or months, but for now, the above has been my experience so far. I hope that it helps.
R3S3AJPGY2SIDZ	3.0	SO close yet so far	19	27	3.5 Stars... I think this is a very good machine and it could be a 5 star PC in the right hands. Well, there are still some bugs in it which make it hard to truly be 5 stars, so maybe 4 to 4.5 stars in the right person. Let me go through each of the factors. The battery isn't very good. My battery right now is at 100% and it says 6 hrs remaining. I have the 1300$ model with i5 and 256 GB memory. Anyway, this battery drains fast and is low capacity. I think you maybe get 6 to 7 hrs out of this for the first however many months. Eventually this will be giving you 5-6 hrs. That's crazy to think I would spend $1500 on a device that may last 5 hrs. I imagine you like me would expect a $1500 device to last more than 12 months, I usually use a device anywhere from 2-3 years before itching to upgrade and I do NOT think this would last that long. The fact that you are already occasionally looking at a 6 hr battery life on some charges with a brand new device is a HUGE problem. I thought about buying the surface pro 3 at one point but figured they would really nail it this time and waited months and months for this device. There were rumors about this releasing in July back in April, well rumors kept coming but the device didn't release until October. What about the actual device? I think the screen is pretty sweet when it's working. Great resolution and color, as good as any device I've seen. But there is a flicker on the screen and a tinting problem where the color changes like you hit the tint button on your TV and everything shifts to a different shade of green. This isn't something small, it would be noticeable by any human being looking at the screen. It's like this 1-2 sec tint change then back to the normal color. Seems to be software, but maybe it's hardware? I don't know. I'm sure this is a widespread problem because I read about in during this first week of release with many other people. Google it and I'm sure you will find out more. The computer otherwise seems super fast, windows 10 is actually solid except for some bugs, and I like the windows interface. WIndows 8 was kind of junk and they really fixed 10. With that said there are still bugs. That means sometimes the keyboard was plugged in and it didn't recognize it and I had to restart. Its odd to snap in this keyboard and have the magnet working but you type and nothing is going through. Since I'm on the keyboard, it really is solid. I think it's wayyyyy better than the previous keyboard. The keys are solid and easy to type on and get used to. As good as any other laptop. The trackpad feels great but it's NOTHING close to apples trackpad. I don't know what apple did or whatever, but their trackpad use on any macbook, macbook pro, macbook air is 10 times better. I challenge you to go to bestbuy and visit espn.com or any website with long feed and just slide up and down the website. There is a noticeable difference in the trackpad. Like the difference between a mercedez and a honda. For example, you have to position your fingers and slide at just the right speed to move things down, and often it doesn't respond - so to move down say 5 pages worth of space I may have to lift my fingers 3-4 times and constantly be sliding - sometimes only twice, etc. On the apple track pad it's once and it's silky smooth. So overall, great keyboard for it's size and sturdyness but crapy trackpad.... I've give the keys 4.5/5 and the trackpad likea 3/5. Screen is 5/5 when it's not bugging out and flickering for a few seconds here and there. I don't know how to grade it because of this. I really do like windows 10. I almost feel like it's a superior OS to Mac's OS. Feels more productive and easier to navigate and the new start bar and findinng stuff seems pretty good. Cortana or whatever the Siri app is, that's not so hot yet. It doesn't really pick up language very well but it's cool to know you can push the pen to have it respond. Ah, the pen. The pen seems very very cool. Very responsive, screen is nice to write on. Great responsiveness and feel. They did very well on this. I don't like one note though, it's solid but you can't zoom in and out to write, like a pinch to zoom with your fingers. It's not the best note program. I feel like it would be good for lecture notes in school but less good for creating my own notebook (I'm a doctor). But overall, I think the speed and responsiveness of the pen will be on par with the apple pen. I think this device is as fast and more capable than the ipad pro. But I believe I will be getting the ipad pro, because the reality is I don't need to use photoshop or many full apps - and the few that I do, it's not worth having a $1500 device that only lasts 6-7 hrs of battery. PLUS the issue for me is I will be using tablet mode more than laptop mode, and I think that is where this device may work better for some... let me explain. This device is BAD as a tablet. It's very difficult to use programs built for desktop as a tablet. The resolution is so high that it's hard to tap many of the buttons, for example. Go to best buy and start using a web browser like chrome or even the new windows browser.... the icons to open or close the browser are like 0.7 cm or something... well, there are some apps that haven't been optimized for surface pro - for example a popular flashcard program called anki, the icons to hit in this program with your finger are like 0.2 cm. That's like the size of 2 pennies stacked on top of each other. It's literally impossible for you to put your 1 cm finger on a 0.2 cm icon - or you just keep tapping trying to hit it just right. It's annoying. Which is the whole issue! This is a laptop, and I feel like if you use laptop mode 90% of the time you will be happy, as you can either use the trackpad or a mouse and navigate fine. But if you are more tablet like me... I bet I will use my finger 80% of the time, then this isn't your device. Tablet mode on windows 10 is worthless right now because the apps aren't build for tablet mode, they are built to run on a desktop with a mouse. Even apps like evernote are hard to navigate and look blurry and pixelated because it hasn't been optimized for such high resolution on a small screen. It's impossible to use with your finger unless you want to go crazy. I think the CEO of apple was right that the tablet OS should be separate. Simply because the app builds are completely different. With all that said, I feel like this is a great device as far as screen, processing power and keyboard. The trackpad is average and the battery is terrible. I can accept simple flaws in my devices, there are always tradeoffs - but not for $1500 after the keyboard purchase and tax. In the end I would recommend you buying an awesome laptop and a good tablet for the same price. Either a macbook for $1500 and you lose the pen would be better with battery life and performance, or just get a nice $1000 laptop and a $300 tablet. Either way, you are better off. I guess this could be great for a student - the pen is great and if you do art then maybe it's awesome, but to really use high level processing you'll end up with a $2000 device which is insanity. Just get a great desktop and a solid laptop and you will have better performance all the way around. The question microsoft is trying to answer is can this device replace an awesome laptop and a tablet? Its hard to say because you can find some great laptops for $1000-1200 right now. And there are plenty of simply tablets for $300. To combine the devices to carry less is one argument, but if you are getting better performance, e.g. battery life and less bugs then I say go for the laptop. and if you want to use a tablet then just get an ipad. I wanted to love this product and had such high hopes, but it's just not a solid all around performer. I'm sure they will fix the bugs within a few months - the battery was a huge fail. They should have just sacrificed screen quality for a 10 hr battery. To have a battery go from 7 hrs and down to 5 hrs later in it's life is VERY hard to swallow for a $1500 device when so many devices will hold 10 or even 12 hrs. Edit: So I typed that review on my surface, in retrospect, you can type better on a nice desktop keyboard - but I bet you can say that about also every NON premium laptop out there (Surface Book / Macbook are probably desktop equivalent for typing). With that said, I'd like to make an argument TO BUY and NOT TO BUY the surface: I will be the salesman here and tell you why this is an outstanding piece of art. TO BUY: This device is very light, well constructed, looks smooth. Seems to be as fast and perform at a high level, like nearly desktop level. The screen resolution and colors are amazing. The pen is the best thing we've seen on a tablet and the palm rejection is solid. I bet the pen works as well as the Apple pencil. This is a premium device and it's hard to say you won't feel like it does everything you need it to and more. There are no compromises with power, speed - and windows 10 is actually gorgeous and their best OS yet. Even the new office software is nice. And the windows 10 ecosystem dominates anything apple has to offer software wise. Keyboard is compact yet works pretty much as well as a premium laptop, much more sturdy than surface 3. This is a solid purchase! Now I will play the other side and be devil's advocate and tell you why this thing is bad. NOT TO BUY: Windows 10 is still developing. I don't see much buggyness in the desktop windows 10 but on the surface I saw screen tinting issues / flickering, sometimes you click and it's not working or freezing (daily occurrence after 5 days). Like I said, I haven't had these issues in the last 2-3 months on windows 10 desktop - so it's a problem with the touch interface... These problems happened not at all when just using the track pad or like a mouse (except the screen thing). This is simply annoying - we expect bugs in a newer OS and they probably will be fixed, but I don't want to pay $1500+ for something with bugs and that's not primetime ready. It's actually ridiculous to sell something at a premium point and not expect great execution. The keyboard is solid but it's not equivalent to a premium laptop keyboard, pick your surface pro / macbooks. But the trackpad is an absolute disaster. Sure you read that it feels nicer, it does, it's larger, looks great - but the software is crap. PLEASE go use this in a store and load a long website and scroll up and down quickly. You literally keep stuttering and having starts and stops with the surface trackpad. Like an engine that won't start. Then the macbook trackpads (any of them) - are silky smooth. But the real disaster is this battery. It's a 7 hr battery if you're doing normal work. I think if the screen is maxed out and you're playing sound out loud, this thing would easy suck out in < 6 hrs. Think about this for a second, you have a device and you've been gone for 12 hrs - you forget to turn it off and it goes into sleep... THIS THING drains in sleep mode. For example, my ipad I left in sleep mode for like a week and it took like < 10% battery. This surface will drain in sleep mode like > 10% in less than a day, maybe overnight. Not only is it a lower capacity battery, it doesn't seem to manage the battery well when it's off or you're trying to save battery when you're low. This is kind of a deal killer... I mean - what good is your device if it turns off in 5 hrs next year? We all know how terrible it is to make sure you're sitting by an outlet and that you need to plug in constantly- I had a macbook with 11 hr battery for a few weeks before it was stolen and it was like I saw the light. Being able to have a 10 hr battery and never even having to think about where you're sitting or plugging in is HUGE in this day and age - airport, coffee shop, work, whatever - you're good with a 9-10 hr battery. 7 approaching 6 and 5???? That's really the deal killer. In Microsoft's defense, this thing seems to charge pretty rapidly and also can charge from 0 and be used at the same time. I think in less than an hour I had charged like > 30% or something? So I feel like you can charge quickly. Maybe 20 minutes can get you like 15-20%, not sure - but I was impressed with how fast it charged after it ran out. The last killer is tablet mode sucks and it's not even worth talking about. If you use tablet more often than not, you're going to HATE this. It's HEAVY for a tablet, it's super light for a computer you carry around but a tablet that you're sitting with reading? HEAVY. I mean, here's my thing - Dell has an excellent 13 inch laptop for like 900 bucks. I guarantee it works / performs close to this - except for the touch factor - but that leaves you with $600 for a tablet still. For example that Dell xps 13 gets 12 hrs!!! 12 hrs of battery, add your $600 tablet? Ipad Air 2 for $600 and you have another 10 hrs of battery. 22 hrs of battery... same cost (or you could go google nexus 9 for $300, or a samsung premium tablet for $600) , I would argue better experience on tablet and probably better experience on laptop. THE ONLY way you may be able to argue the surface here - "easier to carry" which is a weak argument for me, we are talking about 1.5 lbs vs like 2.5 lbs - and the tablet will be nicer to hold in bed or when you're just browsing. You get the same memory or more and everythign is cloud based now anyway, so it's VERY easy to use multiple devices. The other argument is that I need the pen because I'm an artist, well - for artists this review isn't for them. I think this may be a good device for a college student also. The surface as a tool is a great tool except the battery life kind of kills it. My real issue with this device is that it tries to combine the best of both worlds YET it sucks as a laptop (not as good keyboard, trackpad, or battery life) and it sucks as a tablet (not as good for holding for easy browsing or using a touch interface on desktop adds is very annoying and impractical. This device may be a winner at $1000 price point, but certainly not at a $1500 price point. And YES, I include the surface keyboard in the price because let's be honest, 95% of people with the surface will own the keyboard,it's almost like selling a car and it's wheels separately - let's just put it all in 1 fee guys. no games. Edit #2: I wanted to take a video of the screen changing colors and flickering. Over 1 minute it happens a few times and the screen color change can be seen on this also. I also have seen people saying they get 7-9 hrs out of this battery? That must be a joke. Depending on where you keep your screen brightness... I have the screen on 100% brightness and it says 57% energy with 57 minutes, I kid you not. The video I placed shows a similar number. If I drop the brightness to 75% then it now says 1 hr and 41 minutes. I mean, this is DAYS OLD guys. A few days old. This is a joke. I just uploaded a video with the %'s of battery, funny thing, there was a bug when I was filming it and the battery life showed in the upper LEFT instead of the bottom right (you'll notice I pause for a few seconds because I literally don't know WTF just happens and then realize it's trying to show the battery in the upper left, lol). This is just an example of dozens of bugs I'm running into. Next, I think in 1 minute the screen flickered 3 times? You can also see the difficulty I have with scrolling up and down a page. Now, you can swipe JUST right - right speed and motion to try and get the page in one swoop - but I'm not kidding you, I'm swiping just how I would on a MacBook and I get the choppy feel here and not on any apple devices. I recommend you don't take my word for it, go use it in a store. I try to present objective info and then my subjective experience/opinions - but you have to decide what is more subjective and make your own choice. I could easily lower my rating from 3 and have no problems seeing as the battery is worse than I thought with only turning up the screen brightness a bit and the flickering WENT crazy with this brightness too. Essentially, the device is unusable on the highest brightness level. Call this a bad unit, call it what you like. I bought the original Nexus 7 which had TONS of issues like this, I returned multiple units and eventually gave up. Just google these issues and I'm sure you'll find it under google news. I'm not interested in trouble shooting devices and returning / re-returning... not when I pay $1500. Sorry. I'm not dumb enough to think apple doesn't have issues with their computers BUT - I've owned multiple ipads and I've NEVER had a problem other than the initial buggy OS releases which are typically fixed up in a week or 2. And the MacBook screens are great, batteries are great. This battery was somewhere around 1 hr!!!!! with 50% of the battery life left. This is the first week! Imagine 1 year from now. Sorry - this is so so far from being great. I thought they would have nailed the 4th device as the 3rd device seemed to have everything BUT battery life - but somehow this was a big fail.
R1YO8GZWNDFRUI	5.0	Great for trips, not a 100% laptop replacement yet	2	2	Great laptop alternative but I find it a little bit heavy to carry around (not like an ipad) . Overall I find it great that it runs full windows and full office / windows applications. I also find boot times very fast and the screen is very responsive. overall solid build quality and decent battery life. Not sure I would replace my laptop with this , but it is great to haul around on trips
R378GFBBAWYTUN	5.0	amazing	4	5	It's better than expected as am a Mac user since 2003 and I use to hate windows but windows 10 is so perfect and smooth and the surface hardware is excellent the build Quilty is amazing just one thing is missing which is apps for the tablet mode but am betting now on Microsoft I can't say more except it worth the try as apple won't give us a touch OSX they just gave us a giant iPad
RO3ICTCULCPBN	5.0	I love this tablet	21	30	the surface 4 pro is a more mobile version of the surface book. It really depends on what you are looking for as far as the price goes. The SP4 with the keyboard cover (which increases functionality a lot I think) is about the same price as the book. The book weighs a bit more and takes up a bit more space. I love this tablet. I throw it in my cycling pack and it doesn't really bother me.
R1N4Y3WVXYDK18	5.0	Nothing better for students out there.	4	5	While there are still some software issues that need to be worked out, on the whole this device is fantastic. There is no better pen and touch device out there. This is the Ultimate OneNote machine.
R2DCWNRVWU9WMI	5.0	SP3 was fantastic. This Surface is surprisingly superior	7	10	Upgraded from SP3. SP3 was fantastic. This Surface is surprisingly superior. Why? Keyboard is substantially beater (feels like about 90% as good as a high end laptop) Display is slightly larger, and noticeably better than the SP3 display Pen is substantially improved Plus all the reasons why Surface Pro 3 was so great: run legacy apps, get real work done, be entertained. Updates are automatic, but do them manually when your SP4 first arrives. Microsoft is smart, they are improving their hardware, firmware, and software so it evolves. Highest of recommendations.
RJ8O2PUVHXQ27	5.0	Just Amazing!	1	1	I got my first ever surface a couple of days back and since then, I have been so happy with the product. It boots up so fast, with only like 7 seconds from complete shut down to start screen. I'm still in the process of updating the OS. The screen is just gorgeous. The keyboard is damnnnn good!! I love the trackpad and keybo Its overall fast, responsive and so good.
RLVKHEBHQ1W8O	5.0	The i7 version is worth the price...	1	1	Awesome device. I needed a Windows tablet and plenty of power as I run VM's, Netbeans, Visual Studio, etc and run some additional programming softwares/IDE's and occasionally do some video editing. This SP4 w/ i7 blazes through pretty much everything. Not too worried about throttling as I didn't purchase this device for gaming, that's what my desktop rig is for.
R1OGR4PE7RG40Q	4.0	Good Device, almost DOA pen.....	3	4	Well, so far the Surface Pro is nice, but the pen died in under and hour. I tried all the troubleshooting online, and then went to Microsoft for support. After 90 minutes of dinking around, they finally agreed to replace it - they said it should arrive in 6-8 days.... ouch !! I just ordered another pen on Amazon which arrives in a day - hopefully it was a fluke......
RD4YFCNTD2CNS	5.0	At first I was a little skeptical, coming from ...	3	4	At first I was a little skeptical, coming from an apple user to microsoft. But I got the tablet specifically for use of the pen, illustration, and being able to use full photoshop and creative cloud. As of right now, it seems to be serving my needs well.
R1LAGJFD6JMEG8	2.0	Great Hardware - Beware of the Software	9	14	I purchased a Surface Pro 4 in October directly from Microsoft. Microsoft has built a nice piece of hardware that fills an important niche for the true tablet computer - not a "pad" or a "tablet" - a real computer with muscle. The screen resolution is great, the pencil works well and in included with the purchase. The keyboard trackpad is noisy and distracting - but it works well. Their direction with Windows - for a single operating system across computer, tablet and mobile devices is long overdue. Apple should take note of that. That said, I'm rating this 2 stars because of frustrations with Windows 10 - making the Surface Pro product less desirable. In my experience, the Windows-Surface combination has been unstable and subject to serious security issues. I had to reset my Surface Pro to factory setting once already to clean out malware. The entire computer locked up on me once -- black screen of death -- and it took some doing to revive it. The Windows default browser is pretty useless and even has difficulty connecting to Microsoft websites. When I've tried to get to their support area I get messages that the server is down, or not available or whatever. So, my Surface Pro stays in airplane mode except when it is absolutely necessary to get on-line. We pray it works during presentations and other times when we need it to --- so far so good. All this said, it is my understanding that most Windows advocates understand the shortcomings of the OS and have sound work arounds, other 3rd party software (like Google-Chrome Browser), that makes things work. If you are comfortable with Windows and need the portability of a tablet computer this could be a great device for you. For the record, I attempted to post a similar review directly with Microsoft and they refused to post it -- I guess they only want the most favorable reviews on their site. Thank you Amazon, for being fair minded.
R3UYS9Q2GPZSTJ	5.0	A great product, with a HIGH pricetag!	9	14	I have put off purchasing a Surface Pro for a while, as I was mainly unimpressed with them up until now. I have been using an ASUS Transformer for two year, and although it was an OK device, it wasn't quite everything that I was needing. I have been using my Surface Pro 4 now for a few weeks, and I am in LOVE with this machine. The versatility is outstanding, but that does not mean it is without it's faults. Here is an honest review of the pros and cons: Pros: 1. Processing power - I chose the Core I-5 for the price difference. I know that some say it will be noisier and batter life will suffer, but I have found neither of those to be true. I am getting roughly 10 hours of up time on my device with no problem, sometimes more, and sometimes less. My fan rarely comes on, and my device does not heat up. I did not "need" the extra processor, but for the price difference, I felt it was worth it, just in case. Programs load snappy, and I have no problem running rather in depth Powerpoint Presentations. 2. Screen - I know that this device does NOT have Ultra High Def, but it does just fine for me. The screen is very bright if turned up all the way, and normally I run mine at around 50%. I do not use high power games or 3D rendering, so those were not issues for me. The screen is clear, responsive, and a joy to have. 3. The Pen - Say what you will, but I never thought I would use the pen, but now I find myself using it all the time. I love how it snaps to the side magnetically. It is a very strong hold, and have never lost it, or had it pop off. That being said, I do NOT keep it snapped on to the side when I am transporting it. It stays in a compartment in my bag. Having the one, two, or hold clicks is a HUGE help. One click and it opens one note, two clicks takes a screen shot, and hold it to bring up Cortana. I love the S-Pen on my Note 5, so this is a HUGE one for me. 4. Portability - This unit is just plain portable. No more lugging around a heavy laptop or suffering the small screen of my old Ultra-Book. This does it all for me. Plenty of power to get what I need, good battery life, and light weight. Cons: 1. Not NEARLY as well built as an Ipad or a MacBook Pro. This sucker is plastic, not aluminum or glass. That being said, it is still a quality device. All of the ports work well (Unlike my ASUS Transformer), the power cord magnetically snaps into place, and the keyboard magnet holds to my unit very well. 2. The Keyboard - The keyboard is a must for me, and this one will do, but it is just NOT the same as a laptop keyboard. The key travel is great. It is backlit which helps on those late night airplane rides. All that being said, it is not my favorite part of my device. 3. Price - This baby is EXPENSIVE! You can find a more powerful device, with more memory, and better RAM at a far lower price. Once you add on the Keyboard dock, and a spare memory card, the price is OUT THERE. That being said, for me it is fully worth the price, for others it will NOT be. Overall: If you travel a lot, such as I do, this is the machine you want to have with you. I know it is expensive, but it is well worth the price to me. The performance is on par with my Ipad (Yes, I love both Mac and PC for different reasons), and runs about the same price. The Office Suite just seems to work better on here, and I cannot get Publisher on my Mac (I wish I could). I do not have to take this out of my briefcase going through security at the airport which saves me a ton of time. I get all the power I need while on the road, and if not, I can use the computer at the hotel if I absolutely have to (I haven't had to yet). I get a lot of looks and questions asked to me at the airports and by other road warriors.
R1MMT1LCD9OCS	5.0	Great unit so far	2	3	Great unit so far! Elegant execution and functionality. Snappy performance from i5 4GB RAM 128GB disk. The pen works great! Don't be surprised if you only have 80GB of space left after loading all your software, apps, and utilities.
RCMMZYIDQEKW1	5.0	Excellent build quality	2	3	Excellent build quality, gorgeous screen, good keyboard and touchpad. The only problem I have is the display driver constantly crashing but that's software problem and microsoft promised to fix it soon
RVH7XTRLNU6D7	5.0	Just got this yesterday, the i7 one, installed ...	2	3	Just got this yesterday, the i7 one, installed the art program I used and they work quite well, no lag that's noticeable yet. Will see how well it is later on.
R3GFUNM6I3BRI9	1.0	It's pretty but still needs development.	9	14	I wanted to love this product but was a HUGE disappointment. This product has some pretty serious video driver issues.
RVWMDEY8QIHRV	4.0	Four Stars	0	0	I am getting great use out of it so far. Mainly using it for school as a teacher.
RZ3LQVJMJJQIP	3.0	Wait for Surface Pro 5 - the 4 is not worth the premium price if you have a 3	6	10	I've been a Surface Pro user for a few years now and I still rely on my Surface Pro 3. I probably would have passed on the 4 but I dropped my 3 and figured I should see if the 4 hype is warranted. It isn't. The increase in speed, graphics clarity and camera power weren't particularly noticeable to me. I did notice that the 4 I received ran hot. It ran noisily - the fan ran too often and too long, well, maybe not as long as I would prefer since the battery life is pretty minimal. I returned the 4 within days - if you have a 3 - wait for the 5.
R2F81CCYGBCSPU	3.0	5 Star laptop, 2 Star tablet	2	4	You will like it if you mainly use it as a laptop. I dose all the job that a PC can do and it's extremely portable which is why I liked it. However, I experienced multiple issues when I use it as a tablet. 1. The camera is terrible. I have to stay still for about 10 seconds until it can finally focus and take the photo. And there's a lot of glitches during video shooting. 2. the pen is not very smooth. 3. had some other issues during web browsing.
R2G91N4AYRROYN	5.0	Hooked	2	4	My first surface pro and must say I'm impressed. The quality and performance alone have me locked for future versions. Going from windows 7 to 10, still learning the ins and out of the system. I found if you disable some of the background apps you'll have longer battery, going to remove some of the apps I've no need of.
R335QAKJ6H01IZ	2.0	Loses too much battery in Standby mode (or never enters Standby?) (or Sleep/Wake button just turns off display?)	6	11	(The title of this review is trying to describe the problem but I actually don't know what the problem is. It is NOT my job to QA a brand new device. And I cannot troubleshoot it because... the battery is dead and I left the charger at the office.) I just unboxed this yesterday at work and brought it home. There were a lot of things to like about this device. The hardware design is pretty impressive, the unboxing experience was better than I expected in some ways. (Although press-and-hold the pen button to pair the pen didn't work the first two times, and really, why not pair it at the factory? I believe iMac does this with trackpad/keyboard.) The screen is beautiful, some of the UI design and hardware integration is really nice, and the Microsoft apps (Fresh Paint, MS Edge browser) bundled with Windows 10 seem pretty good for a touch/pen experience. However, I put the full-charge device to sleep and threw it in my pack and brought it home last night (I do this regularly with a Mac Book Pro). In the morning I pulled the Surface Pro 4 out expecting to use it for even just 15-30 minutes and when I pressed the sleep/wake button, the battery was already dead and it just said Surface and showed a giant sad battery indicator and went back into hibernation. Compare this to my MacBook Pro, which I brought home fully charged last night and just pulled out of the same bag and on waking it has 100% charge, or 7+ hours battery life remaining. This seems to confirm other reviews where they claim a new device loses 12% battery / hour in standby mode until it goes into hibernation. I will have to buy another power supply and keep that at home (or climb on the floor in the dust under my desk and crawl on my hands and knees to unplug and pack up the power adapter -- every single day AND remember to plug it in at home before going to bed, getting down on my hands and knees again). Will I have to close all my apps and shut down every night just to carry it home? How is that different from buying a little $300 desktop from Dell? Maybe there is a workaround to use hibernate? I found some potential workarounds (disable some dumb IR camera stuff -- MS Hello? [1]) but ... I cannot attempt the fix because the battery is dead and I assumed I would have maybe 1 hour battery life the next morning at worst. So many pointless questions. Should I get on the phone with support? Should I return it? Should I try to fix it myself by Googling and turning off features or working around by using hibernate? (This is likely.) If you pretend that this is a desktop device and expect to use it that way (with the occasional touch/pen use), then wow, it is pretty neat (4 stars, would be five but there are cheaper desktops/laptops out there). But if you are tricked into thinking this is a laptop/tablet replacement, I would be skeptical until you hear otherwise (1 star). This is really disappointing from a first party piece of hardware from the OS vendor, and an expensive and brand-new device on top of that. (Note that the Surface Pro 2 had the same sorts of firmware problems (Google it) so it's not like Microsoft has never seen this issue in their own hardware before. On the MS Surface 1, some issues might be expected. But on a version 4 product?) Unfortunately for MS this is not what people are used to. They are used to their smartphones being rock-solid, reliable little computing devices. They are used to tablets (iPads) that sleep and wake instantly and run all day or for multiple days (half the price, too). They are used to (cheaper) workhorse laptops with all-day or multi-day battery life. Imagine buying a Tesla and driving somewhere and having a full battery when you park it at night but waking up to find you are stranded with a dead, overheated battery and a brand new, worthless $100,000 doorstop. You would certainly want your money back and of course a free ride. (You might be curious what little problem caused this or how easy the fix was or if there was a workaround. But really, you would be understandably, massively disappointed.) But when this happens in the Windows ecosystem, is it just par for the course? "Don't get your hopes up!"? If Microsoft wants to improve their reputation and get people excited about their hardware, this seems entirely within reach: their hardware team knows what they are doing. Unfortunately great hardware with flaky software or firmware is just a fancy doorstop. On some level this may be a small thing. It could be fixed. It might be worked around. Technically, this device will work as needed for a desktop if I treat it that way. But why should Microsoft tarnish their reputation by selling a device at 5-star prices that isn't a 4-star or 5-star experience? Maybe they could direct some of their advertising budget into QA and reap massive benefits? Who let this out of the factory? What QA team utterly failed at their job by saying this was not a show-stopping problem? Or what executive should be fired for ignoring QA when they claimed this was a show-stopper? Or what subdivision of MS threw in a piece of software [1] at the last minute that wasn't properly tested but made the device into a doorstop? So many stupid questions and so many lame excuses. Either way the customer loses. Caveat emptor. [1] [...]
R3UUAOVO0SCYE	2.0	Meh	8	14	I did not buy this from Amazon, I got it through Microsoft via pre order to be honest. I feel the unit was too "buggy", sometimes the screen would stop recognizing touch/ pen so it would need to be restarted. The pen doesn't always trigger one note like it should either. I feel the device while fast and responsive tried too hard to be a tablet and a laptop and for me it didn't excel at either. For me and what I need in a work device as a medical device salesman, on the road and in/ out of accounts it didn't work for me. I had purchased the dock (pretty slick) and keyboard and all said was over $1,500, but i didn't want to settle at that price point. My 2 cents is to buy it and work it hard for a week and see if it works for you.
R1GLT13N6MFQZR	5.0	Defective Surface Pro 4, Very Disappointed	3	6	I received my Surface Pro 4 (i5 256gb, 8gb RAM) today and played with it for about 30 minutes. Everything looked well until I put it into sleep and it NEVER wakes up. I've tried two button reboot, didn't work, and contacted Microsoft service. They told me to do a slightly different version to reboot it but still did not work. I will see tomorrow if a nearby Microsoft Store can fix it. Well, the reason why I give it 1 star, beside the defects, is I need to make an appointment with the technician at the store. Updated: It seems like there's a hotfix (firmware update) the day I received it and Microsoft put it on top priority updating it. So the way of avoiding it is to update your Surface Pro ASAP and not put it into sleep. Problem solved, So I will give this beast 5 Stars.
R1JSOBNKEGVCOI	5.0	Five Stars	2	4	Very happy. Fast SSD. Beautiful screen. Great OneNote integration. Quick updates from Microsoft. No complaints as of now.
RZHMRK0YC97UR	4.0	Awesome look and features, Heavily priced	6	11	I'll give short and sweet review of surface pro 4. Every thing is just awesome, but price is too high for regular users like me. So, the question that remain in your mind is whether you should buy it or not? Well, if you love to stay up-to-date, love to draw, love to be unique, love to carry laptop at various places, love office then this surface pro is for you. If you are just a regular internet user, or school student, then better to stay with surface pro 3 or other cheaper devices with same specs. All the software features of this device, you can get at 30-50% lower price. Soon there will be Black Friday in US and there will be definitely better deal from Microsoft on all of its devices, so wait for 1 month if you can. After all, It's your choice whether to get one now or not. I love windows more than OS X and I love to stay updated and so bought this. Taking away 1 star just for the price.
R24UVO66BZEZDT	5.0	Love	2	4	Flat out Love, its so smooth, i am very picky when it comes to what i expect this has not let me down yet.
R3UURM1OKU8JRC	5.0	Almost Perfect Hybrid	3	6	A fifteen minute setup and I'm writing this review on it.. Setup was quick and easy. Everything worked right out of the box. This hybrid device is what you would expect from a well refined high-quality product. Perfect for my needs; Very light, mobile, and a sufficiently powerful computer capable of handling a good amount of work. Not sure how much more it can be improved. Money well spent.
R358HMXBWJ0QWD	4.0	Very good, but short of excellent	2	5	I think the market for this is someone who wants a tablet and notebook all in one - which is exactly how they market it so no surprise there. However with that said just note that it doesn't do either thing as well as a dedicated tablet or notebook. I had the Surface Pro 3 for a month last year before returning it at the last moment as I just couldn't justify the cost, and I think I might end up doing the same thing here - however I have a ton of computers and tablets so that is certainly a big factor. However the main huge factor is I also ended up getting an iPad Pro... and that is fantastic and makes me pretty much never pick up the Surface. This doesn't mean the Surface is bad, it's excellent - it's just not as excellent as my iPad Pro or my MacBook Pro (which is running Windows 99% of the time so it's not an OSX deal). Again however if you want only one device this is an excellent signal solution, it doesn't do anything poorly, but again it rarely excels at anything either. More thoughts... The screen is excellent - it looks great, gets pretty bright, has good color and is fairly accurate on the color. The pen is very good - but not excellent. Compared to the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil, the pen on the Surface is fairly slow to respond - I mean the vast majority of people won't really know it, but if you're using it for art or design, there isn't quite enough precision to replace a Wacom, but I'd put it on-par with Wacom's cheapest offerings like a Bamboo. If you're just using it to take notes it should work well enough. The other note is Windows... it's not always fun to use with the pen. Using this with Photoshop can be frustrating as Windows often will think you're swiping in from the edges, etc - hopefully it's something MS can take care of in future Windows updates. Speed is quite good but remember this is a dual core mobile processor, it's no slouch but it's not going to keep up with a non-compact notebook in the same price range. 8GB of ram is fine, but seriously it's 2015, almost 2016... Windows 10 does a great job with lower RAM requirements but this should have 16GB of ram at this price level, that would make me feel a lot better about keeping this a few years. 256GB SSD is again fine, but again I'd hope for more at the price range - but I'll take an SSD anyday over a larger non-SSD, so I guess it will do - but anyone can look-up the prices of drives and you'll know there isn't a $400 price difference between a 256 and a 512gb drive. The performance of the drive is pretty snappy, no complaints there. Form factor is good, but this goes back to it being a jack of all trades. Somehow this (without the keyboard) is supposed to weigh the same as the iPad Pro, yet if you hold both you'd swear the iPad Pro is lighter, and quite a bit lighter. If you're comparing this to a tablet this is quite large still - and since you have a fan in there it can get a bit loud. This isn't a big deal and rarely happens but just something to keep in mind if you think you're getting a true tablet - it's the price you pay for having a full PC in your hands. Personally I'm not a huge fan of holding the Surface, it feels great but it feels like if you dropped it more than a foot it would shatter. That is most likely not the case, but it feels very dense and thus dropping it feels like it would be a big deal. If you're comparing it to a notebook then this is an excellent size - but while the new keyboard is a huge upgrade over the Surface Pro 3 keyboard, it's still not up to par with a decent notebook keyboard. Again it's not bad at all, just not excellent. Overall it probably sounds like I'm bashing the Surface more than I actually intend, I really do like it and if I had to choose to either get a tablet or a notebook, then I'd get this since it does both. But I'd much rather have a proper notebook and a full on tablet. Purchased this at a chain store so it won't say verified, but I did indeed purchase it...
RUJ8J24KGRFLD	5.0	Five Stars	2	4	Amazing product!. I like it. The best
R3SNHSIGP2YIA	5.0	A Quantum Leap!	4	8	The Surface Pro 4 is a quantum leap! I thought my SP3 was an incredible computer but the SP4 is awesome! I just don't "get" the negative reviews. It's a laptop replacement and an outstanding tablet. I installed Office 2016 yesterday and the speed of the i5 processor is amazing. Don't hesitate to buy this computer.
R15U8T79K0XLN6	2.0	Sceptical at first, then I like it. Update: Disappointed with OS. It is not made for tablet.	3	7	Update: The Surface Pro 4 refuses to auto-rotate the screen today. I checked every setting I could and I still couldn't get the screen to auto-rotate. I had to reset the tablet. Then the pen refused to connect. I am tired of constantly to manual select the on screen keyboard. The OS is not ready for tablet use. It probably will be better if you use it as a hybrid tablet/laptop. I just received it today and I am already using it to annotate my PDFs, which is the main reason I bought a tablet with a pen. I was sceptical at first. I had a Microsoft Windows 8 tablet before and it was so horrible. Windows 10 doesn't strike me as an outstanding OS (yet). I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with a full blown OS. I can use all the softwares I am used to on my desktop. Not all apps work with the stylus but I mostly use the PDF annotation app (which comes with the tablet. I guess Microsoft knows what their customers are expecting.) I wish there are more apps designed for the pen. I am still tempted to get the iPad Pro since probably apps are available to use with stylus on iPad. On Windows, most people probably going to use a keyboard. I have a few laptops and I don't need a laptop replacement. I have not already run any benchmarks on Core M. It seems pretty responsive to me. The 4 GB ram seems sufficient. I don't expect to play games on this tablet. iPad Pro is probably more fun to use. It depends on what you are looking for. If you want practicality, get a Surface Pro. If you want something fun, get an iPad Pro.
R3UYEBI9ABA67G	1.0	Join Microsoft Beta Testing today for only $1000!	14	25	I've had one a week. So far: WiFi slow and buggy. Intermittently drops signal. Defect in glass. Had one unit replaced. Pen broken during normal use (they're sending a new one, takes a week). Touchscreen crashes during normal use at least once every 2 hours (happened 6 times today). Customer support barely speaks English, has no real answers and their solution to fixing my problems is to reset it, wipe it and start over, refresh it (so once every 2 hours I just start over from nothing!!! FIXES EVERYTHING!!!) I had a 1st Gen Surface Pro. Loved it. No problems. This one is $1000 trash. Buy one if you want to join the ranks of Microsoft Beta Testing, because it is FAR from a quality, finished product.
R1GM0LP5NPVD6H	2.0	but seems like it's stuck at 6%	3	7	So after living with the freezes, the audio pops and issues waking from sleep mode I finally got cheesed off because location services weren't working and Cortana wouldn't recognise the microphone. Resetting now, but seems like it's stuck at 6%. It's been at this point for nearly an hour. I know others on here have implied they've got more than 8 hours battery life, but even with the screen dimmed to 25% the Surface only lasted around 3 hours tonight before I had enough. I really love the Surface when it works, but it has too many issues and I'm seriously considering taking it back for a refund - a laptop that costs nearly a grand with type cover shouldn't be this borked. Microsoft should have seriously fixed all these issues before launch. They've really put me off to the point where I'm tempted to go and look at the iPad Pro instead.
RU5J3WXOJOOGL	2.0	Argh, just not there as a Tablet PC	7	14	I've been out of the Windows game for a few years. The last time I seriously used Windows was when Windows 7 just came out, and I've been using Macs, ChromeOS, and Android for my computing since. However, as a former die-hard user of the Windows Tablet PC (I was a Microsoft MVP, ran a website and blog), I have always looked at the Surface with a wanting. Driven by the newest version, which included a better keyboard, touchpad, and pen, AND a generous 30 day return policy, I walked into a Microsoft Store and bought one. Two days later I returned it. So what's wrong with the thing? Well, first there's just general quality issues. My tablet had a dead pixel out of the box. I'm sure this would've been replaced, no problem, but it irked me. I haven't had this issue with any other device I've purchased, though I hear it's more common place. Secondly, it's Windows 10. As much newness as there is, there's a lot of stuff just painted over with a new theme, and other stuff that's just sitting there as relics from the past. When trying to configure some stuff in Control Panel, I was greeted by dialog boxes that hadn't changed since 2002, down to the artwork and icons. There's just so much of Windows 10 that has been left on the vine from previous versions that kills the feeling of using a modern operating system. Third, it's the digitizer. I owned one of the first N-Trig digitizer based tablets (Dell's Latitude XT circa 2008) and it wasn't that good then and it's still not that great. The touch performance is nearly flawless, which is great. The pen performance left me wanting for a Wacom-based model. I know there are tradeoffs here, but the quality of the writing experience suffered. Strokes felt squishy. I didn't feel the same precision as I did with old wacom based models. Fourth, it's the software. Related to my second point, I found many pieces of software that simply hadn't been updated in years. I tried Mindjet's MindManager 2016, just released. The tablet functionality that they boast looks like it hasn't been updated in 7 years, and is barely usable on a high resolution device like the Surface. Other quirks like the software keyboard covering up the field you're typing in are common across the operating system. It just seems like not much care was put into making this an awesome tablet. Finally, touchpad performance was pretty abysmal. I know they've made improvements here, but scrolling through webpages was such a broken experience. To be fair, scrolling using touch on the screen is pretty flawless. Unfortunately, I couldn't really make use of the Surface as a laptop because of the excessively poor touchpad performance. The keyboard is pretty good though. So, perhaps I'll wait for the Surface Pro 5 and try again, but for right now, if you're looking for a tablet PC, I don't think Surface Pro 4 or Windows 10 is there yet.

Worked fine the first day, and then the next day it had a registry error during start up. Unable to complete a restore or full reset. Then stuck with 'surface' screen on and off. Couldn't turn the machine off or stop that cycle. Miserable launch by M$. Waiting for a replacement.

And it is by far the best technical device I have ever bought. For now, I have nothing but positive to say. Ultra light, incredible screen, super fast. Wow!

Taken me a while to become proficient with it by I just love it. I had a I Pad which I found to be almost worthless for what I wanted to do with it. About all it was good for was getting e-mail when traveling and taking pictures. My Surface Pro 4 way more usable.
R1JL0FEHI1Y9JL	5.0	Wonderful. Camera issues?	1	5	I love my new surface pro 4 (upgrade from the first pro); however, anyone else having problems with the back camera? Returned the first because the back camera didn't work. The camera on my replacement was working, but has now also stopped working (day 2). Everything else is fabulous. Camera situation- annoying.
R11WO6NVDCP8NF	5.0	I did like it, although I did return it	2	7	I did like it, although I did return it, it just didn't fit my needs. Screen was great, amazing picture quality, it was fast, It starts up right away no waiting at all. The pen is great, I liked the little features they put in with the pen. Over all if you are a student that needs to take notes, or are a business professional, or just a person that wants a really beastly windows tablet/hybrid its a great buy.
RNXBB2NJ4CDE0	1.0	So many bugs	3	9	So many bugsI'm returning it because there's too many bugs to handle. The graphics driver crashes every 3 minutes when watching YouTube or playing a game online that relies on Flash. The battery life? It's freaking horrendous. It advertises 9 and I'm lucky to get 3. No, I'm not the one with a glitches SP4 because I've exchanged it MULTIPLE TIMES and they all had a different problem. You lost a customer Microsoft, I thought I'd actually leave Apple for you, and I love the concept of the laptop, but I can't Stand these dank bugs.
R21JSNTYVP10D8	5.0	Wow! Just Wow!	1	5	What a great tablet! This is a beast!
R29H80XO0OD30T	1.0	Automatic Repairs Hell	6	15	Out of the box, the first one wouldn't boot. It was stuck in Automatic Repairs hell. None of the options to restore or reset it worked. I exchanged it and the second one worked for about an hour and now has the same issue. Too bad. It seemed like a good piece of hardware and filled a niche. I'm not going to risk having the same issue after weeks or months of use when it has my docs and content on it, though. Can't trust it.
R3PBBV52LTUYD2	5.0	Five Stars	3	9	Great product and a great price... Delivered on time...
RWUS8DN7EEGQJ	5.0	Nice	3	9	I like it, better than the previous model
R9L1PHX5LO3WO	2.0	Having Issues	9	21	Very disappointed. Have been using it for two days. I do like the idea of it, the size, design, build quality and functionality. HOWEVER, it is having all types of problems. Freezing, restarting on its own, pen stops working, touch screen stops responding, screen changes hues when scrolling, the type cover has issues too some of the keys do not register. As typical with Microsoft, the product is 80% functional at release. Will be returned.
RI8SX5LA323IC	1.0	WiFi Warning: This may impact your decision	14	31	The SP4 has the same Limited Connectivity WiFi issue as previous SP's. Microsoft says (11/1) an corrective update will be coming, yet can't say when. Until then, there is no wifi for most cable providers or public access points (I.e. s'bucks) therefore severely limiting use by people to actually use the device as designed. You can verify this issue by checking MS tech forums. Until this issue is resolved, I really can't recommend any S/SP device.
R2ELDRKYYL744K	1.0	Good Hardware + Bad Software = Piece of S***	14	32	This is my review as a student and an avid windows 7 fan. First of all, this is a great piece of hardware, and I would love the Pro4 if it wasn't for the hulking dump of crap that is Microsoft Software (windows 10, office, etc.). Here is what happens every time I have 1 hour to study something. 1) Take the surface out of my bag and push the power button. WAIT 5-6 minutes for it to boot up, even though I never turned it off. 2) Spend 10-20 minutes trouble shooting my internet connection, and in general deal with the s***ty wifi connection (even when I have full bars, as I can literally see the wifi router). 3) Try to figure out why Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or Note are not starting up (even though the task is running in the manager). 4) Put the surface back in my bag, and use the lab computer. This should not be the case if I paid $1200 for a machine. Here are couple notes to Microsoft: 1) Put a magnet on my $130 keyboard to close and stay closed in my bag. 2) Why is it that whenever I use the pen, my mouse pointer disappears and I can't use the $130 trackpad any more? 3) How come when I'm scrolling with my finger the page is fully responsive, but when I use a trackpad there is a 0.1-0.2 sec delay? And, YES, it ***king matters, because it forces me to take my hands off the keyboard every time I want to scroll!!! 4) Why when I turn on the Pro, the password filed is not focused already? It's not like I can do anything else... 5) Why do I have to tap 3 times to open a keyboard if I don't have the $130 keyboard attached? (If you want to use just the pro and type something, you need to tap the "Keyboard" logo in bot-right corner, then "Change Layout", then "Keyboard" again....) And where the f*is is the default keyboard layout setting??? Long story short... This is a great piece of hardware with horrible/unresponsive/difficult/complicated software. I have never had an Apple, but thanks Microsoft (this is the first and last PC I will return), I am getting an Apple. I just value productivity too much.

It may be that I got a defective unit, but I am just sending it back to amazon for a full refund. very disappointed.... UPDATE Oct 30: I did a full reset and the Surface seems to work better... got the camera and pen working and on the third day haven't seen the dreaded BAD_POOL_HEADER error .... still see some ghosting on my screen when it starts up but is gone after... will keep an eye on it.... will test for another week or so to see if it not a bad unit and if it is worth keeping...
R3OQT1DPR9C5O	2.0	Not Happy	8	25	I thought it had everything I wanted but it just gave me problems right from the start. I downloaded several programs including Dashlink to save my Passwords. Surface never did accept my Dashlink password so I couldn't use it even though all of my other devices accepted that password. None of my other programs worked properly either. After 3 or 4 hours of trying o use the 'Pen' it stopped working altogether. The second day after working on it for a few hours I just gave up. I returned it and am now just waiting for my money to be returned. I will probably just go to a I Pad.

R1NC3WHE539LIR	1.0	Unimpressed	15	45	I actually got my Surface from the Microsoft store, but got some of the accessories here because the Microsoft store was sold out of some of their own accessories. I had the Surface Pro 3 and was looking to upgrade to the new model. After fully charging I received an error message. I called Support who said they would walk me through a 2 to 3 hour reimaging as soon as I locate a 16 gb flash drive for the process. I replied that I did not want to repair a brand new machine, and so was switched to the Microsoft store who said that the Escalation team would contact me in the next few days to handle an exchange. When they finallly got back to me they said I should send the defective surface pro back immediately, but that right now they are sold out and it will be December 4th before they are restocked. As the title says, I'm unimpressed. It looks like I'm going back to Apple.
RCCJ1KS451K9W	1.0	Garbage Do NOT buy.	2	20	Excitedly purchased from the Microsoft online store the first day it was available. But it turned out to be a piece of garbage. Nothing but frustration and problems. Never could get it to work consistently. After one month the keyboard completely stopped working, and I gave up. It's going back on the next UPS truck.

[edit: look for the stories on Forbes for example if you think it's just crazy internet people] Surface Pro 3 was finally getting close to being a decent device (you don't even have to reboot every day!), but so much tracking in the new devices...
R23GU1XZ94PLN0	1.0	Retarded monkeys would've done better.	6	48	Seriously, why release a product you know is junk? First one stopped working entirely after a few days and several hours of time setting up the device. It started with the screen switching to vertical black and coloured lines with a light tap to the top of the device, so there's a hardware problem. After the second time that happened it stopped working entirely. Tech support response? Yes, we know it doesn't work properly. Second one, the task bar stopped working after about an hour of use. Tech support response? Yes, we know it doesn't work properly. Please reinstall the OS. By the way, you can't use the recovery partition we set aside on the SSD, you have to download the same recovery partition and waste a USB stick to be able to use it. So, two major problems that MS knows are there. Two crippling problems. On a very, very expensive device. My advice? Get a Mac. I hate them. The OS is difficult to use, it's not at all intuitive, the keyboard is bad and they're even more expensive. But they work and you can install Windows 7 on them.
