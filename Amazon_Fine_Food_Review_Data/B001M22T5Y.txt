A1GLDG948JBYJ3	2	not as bad as Dilmah	0	0	OK, I wrote a damning review of the Dilmah Green Sencha tea, which I described as tasteless and weak and no relation in any way to Japanese Sencha, so here is a cheaper tea that at LEAST has a minimal taste of something and a subtle flavorful after taste in the back of the throat. It is also, to me, fairly stimulating so there is definitely a fair amount of caffein or caffeine like substance in it. But still not sencha as we know Japanese Sensha.
