A2L4FXJZISAL4T	5	Best chicken broth	4	4	In my experience, this is the best tasting chicken broth you can buy, hands down.  No other broth is close.  We do a lot of cooking and I love to make my own homemade soups, stews, etc, but sometimes you don't have time to make your own stock.  That's when we turn to the Swanson (full salt) chicken broth.<br /><br />Before you ask, yes, we've tried all the other options at the various markets around us (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, SuperFresh, Safeway) and nothing else compares.<br /><br />Also, the funny thing is that the Swanson Low-Sodium broth doesn't compare either (even after you add in additional salt.  The low-sodium version has a much gamier smell and flavor.  Definitely go with the full salt version (even if you have to water it down to decrease the sodium density).  The umami flavor you get in this broth is incomparable relative to its peers.
