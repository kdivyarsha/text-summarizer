A2DQI2OZQ0NNMU	5	Best Refried Beans EVER!!	2	2	I love the Taco Bell brand Refried Beans.  They are the best I've ever had.  I couldn't locate any in the Dallas area, and I looked and call every store only to find that no one had any in stock.  So I ordered them from Amazon.  I hope I'm able to find them soon in Dallas or on Amazon because I would hate to have to do without them.
