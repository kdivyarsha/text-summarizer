A2WLZ0T95T4KMU	5	Hard to find cinnamon bears at a fair price!	4	4	Are these on the endangered species list?? I used to be able to find these at several stores, but not anymore. Please note that these are not the weird, overly-gummy texture you find in Haribo gummy bears, worms, etc. It's much more substantial and more pleasant. The taste is prefect. I love the internet!

A6U3Z8WL2NL4L	1	Nasty	0	0	Nastiest tasting cinnamon bears ever. Taste like ancient pot pourri.  Awful texture and there is no labeling to tell you what the ingredients are.
