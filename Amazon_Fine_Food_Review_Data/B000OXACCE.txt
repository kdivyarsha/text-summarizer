A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ	4	Good Healthy Treat	0	0	These treats are one of my dog's favorites.  They are very hard and made from two good ingredients, chicken and brown rice.  According to the bag, there are no other ingredients such as gluton or preservatives.  I like to break them into two pieces (although difficult to break).  It takes my dog (small mixed breed) several minutes to devour one.  Good for his teeth and low in fat.
