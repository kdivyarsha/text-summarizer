Well, our school is one of them...and this treat makes the perfect contribution to our fall-themed party.  Even though it could equally be used to create spooky jack-o-lantern treats, it can also be used just to make pretty pumpkins that fit right in with our fall theme.  And of course you can't go wrong with a rice krispies treat!  Kids love them (and so do I).  My daughters loved the rice krispies treats pumpkins (which were easy to mold with the enclosed molds and fun to decorate, too) and can't wait to make some to share with their friends."
