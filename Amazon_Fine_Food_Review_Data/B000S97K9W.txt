A3PC94PB6GF5VO	5	If Lucky Charms were a drug, I'd be in rehab....	4	4	The first thing I have to say is that people who pick out the marshmallows and waste the rest should be exiled from this country. This is the best cereal out there. No part of it should ever be wasted. Especially the leftover milk at the bottom of the bowl. The sweet aftertaste of the LC's make the milk heavenly. I eat a bowl of LC's in about 4 minutes average so Amazon's 5 box deal is more of a challenge than a bargain to me. So in conclusion, whether you buy this in your local grocery store or off the divine online shop, Amazon, you really can't go wrong with Lucky Charms.<br /><br />Thank you and goodnight.
