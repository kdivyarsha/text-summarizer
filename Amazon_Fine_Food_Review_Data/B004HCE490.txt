A2EF7WM25HEXDV	5	Best dip mix ever!	0	0	I've been using this stuff for years.  My mom used to mix it with sour cream for dip for chips.  However, I'm now mixing it with plain greek non-fat yogurt and it makes a great dip for carrots, chips, veges, french fries, etc.<br /><br />If you're trying to stay healthy and want a tasty dip, get this stuff and make your own.  It's totally worth the $13.
