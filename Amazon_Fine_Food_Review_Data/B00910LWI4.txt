I love it because you can use any soft fruit or make a combination.  My favorite is strawberry mango.  I would suggest crushing up the fruit, stirring in the mix to see how the jam sets up.  Then if it needs the extra half cup of water add it.  I guess some fruit looses water as it sits in the fridge :)
