A29T8MO1MSH81F	1	Bad handles	1	1	This item showed up timely and in one pc. The handles are attached at the base of the tin box and the workmanship was terrible. The first time I grabbed the handles one broke and I was unable to fix it. There is a small flap of metal that comes out of the base and a small hole in the handle that the flap goes through. If it's not done right you are out of luck. It's a matter of time til the other handle breaks.
