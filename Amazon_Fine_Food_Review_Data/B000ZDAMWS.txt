AI7NCUE8SK4DE	1	its not even garlic oil	10	10	"Its an outright lie that this product is garlic oil.  It is garlic flavored soybean oil an its simply outrageous that they have the gall to market it as garlic oil.  If I wanted oil from gene modified soybeans I could run down to Dollar General and get a lot larger bottle for $1.  Of course I'd have to crush a garlic clove or 2 to flavor it, but at least I'd know that it was actual garlic in it rather than the ""garlic extracts"" that Roland uses to flavor their soybean oil.  This product stinks, and I don't mean of garlic.  Amazon should not even allow this fraudulently labeled product to be distributed through under their banner, but at the very least one ought to be able to put a minus sign into the rating so I could give it a minus 5 stars."
