A3NUKK1ZFZ8YG1	5	One of my favorites	3	3	This is one of my favorite teas from Octavia. It smells great and tastes even better. Perfect combination of black and red tea. And I think you can equally taste the vanilla and the coconut. Everyone I've served it to so far has liked it. It's one of the teas I don't want to run out of.
A2SYU4RXCCPI93	5	Very Yummy Tea	0	0	I ordered this tea both for myself and as a gift (since it comes as a pack of 2).  The tea is packaged well for freshness, and it smells and tastes GREAT!  I recommend using 1.5 teaspoonfuls of tea to each 8 ounces of water, steep for 3.5 minutes.  I will definitely be reordering this tea once I start to get low on this batch.  Thanks, Octavia, for a great loose leaf tea product!
