I'd been looking for a new snack item that wasn't over the top with fat and salt.<br /><br />These sticks are light and delicious, and I have since tried them in nearly every flavor available. The sea salt flavor is on the light side, but they're still very good, and are wonderful with a sandwich or salad.<br /><br />Give them a try ... you may be pleasantly surprised ... as I was :)"
