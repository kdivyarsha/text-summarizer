A2Y695A1DXMT1J	3	Hard to Describe	0	2	I would first like to say that I really enjoyed the beautiful packaging! But this food is hard to describe. It's a bar made of caramel wafers covered in chocolate; but the feel of the wafers are not like ordinary wafers. It isn't sticky, but it is quite chewy. Imagine, if you will, caramel puffed up and made into wafers. I'm not sure whether I like this. It's very unusual.
