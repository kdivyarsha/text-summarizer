A1RZZHF2FCGA0H	1	What A WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY!!	0	0	This is not the first time I have purchased this product..The first time the product came packaged very nicely in a styrofoam box and was frozen,,,and after I had cooked it it was great..Anyway this time when I got the roast the first thing iI noticed was it came in a plain box with only 2 melted ice packs and in some sort of silver colored material.....The meat was discolored on one end and it smelled horrible!!!OMG what a waste..The meat was sooo bad it looked like it had been shipped and had turned rotten before it was shipped!!! I am sorry if my grammer is rather jumbled..But I am very upset....Shame on this company for sending a customer rotten meat!! Please do not under any circumstances buy from this company ever!! :(
