I came back from Germany a few weeks back and stocked up on various Haribo products at a gas station to rid myself of Euro coins I had in my pockets. Mega-Roulettes, Saft Goldbaren, Happy Cola, Weinland, Fruchtgummi M&ouml;pse (Extra Sauer). Out of all these Haribo products, the Saft Goldbaren were the best. Just like the original goldbaren, these have the perfect consistency. the package claims ""with 22% fruit juice"" and i totally believe it. Very flavorful: blackcurrant, pear, apple, peach, lime, and raspberry.<br /><br />I just wish I came back to the US with more bags, now I have to pay shipping costs that are more than the candy itself!"
