A1PRPFJQPEOP0C	2	NOT the regular size gumballs that you see in the store	0	0	"Bought these thinking they were the 'regular-size' gumballs sold in the store, variety tubes, as pictured, but was delivered tiny 'penny' gumballs in tubes, and they are ALL pink.<br /><br />The regular size gumballs sell between 80 cents and a dollar a piece, so this seemed like a good deal, getting 36 tubes for $16.<br /><br />The tubes that I received are all marked ""25 CENTS"" right on top, but as you will notice in the picture on the listing, the tubes are all turned around so that you can't SEE this.<br /><br />(However, the photo DOES feature the variety of colors/flavors).<br /><br />Do the math, 25 cents a tube, 36 tubes, $9.00.  I just paid $15.90 for $9 (RETAIL) worth of gum.<br /><br />Deceptive listing.  Feeling ripped off.<br /><br />OH, and to top it all off....they're STALE."
