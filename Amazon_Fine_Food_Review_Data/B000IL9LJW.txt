ANKM1RMQ4RKQ6	2	Evolve Kitten Formula	1	1	My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat will not eat the Evolve Kitten Formula, so I cannot recommend it.  I am forced to only award 2 stars.  Even when I mix a small amount of Evolve in with other kibble that he eats, my cat is able to separate the Evolve from the other kibble and leave it in the bowl when most of the other cat food has been eaten. Evolve does come in a nice bag featuring a resealable strip, that many kibble cat food bags lack.
