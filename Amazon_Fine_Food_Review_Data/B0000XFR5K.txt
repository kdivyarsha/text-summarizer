A1JY7N9VQBY2S3	1	Weak bitter tea. Not typical taste for chinese green tea	0	0	I drink a lot of Chinese green tea. This is a bitter weak tea, which I have<br />not experienced with tea I have shipped from china through [...]<br /><br />I tried another expensive tea through market spice. It tasted like it had<br />bad perfume added. Market spice said nothing was added.<br /><br />I will not order any tea from this company again.
