A2KHVD222A926T	1	Not really ayahuasca?	11	12	The data sheet you get when you buy this clearly says its ayahuasca bark, not vine. Also, the 4:1 thing is most likely a lie, since really this isn't even as potent as normal caapi vine! Much less 4x as potent. It was analyzed and only harmine showed up. No THH. No harmaline. Something wierd is going on with this. Whether its bark or not, its definitely somewhat of a scam. Go to other vendors
