AB7WDWBVDRHET	5	Prime & Subscribe make this great	2	2	I make a lot of crockpot recipes and use stock in many of them. I always bought this in the supermarket, but mine stopped carrying it! Amazon to the rescue - by being Prime, and signing up for the subscription service, I get this delivered at the right schedule, and about a buck cheaper per container than the supermarket charged. Win/win/win.

I was a little concern about the shipping methods, but the containers can in a box that was packed very well in another box.  I will order again.
