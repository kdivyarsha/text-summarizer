A2E2MOLLIMBTMA	5	I love this sauce!	0	0	Wan Ja Shan Organic Ponzu Sauce is the Best! I lightly season Brown rice and almost any vegetable and/or protein and it is amazing. Great for stir fry. My favorite is shrimp and bok chow. And I also love asparagus and chicken or broccoli and beef. SO good and so easy - the sauce is ready just lightly drizzle. you can thinly slice cucumbers and let sit in the Ponzu sauce. Great quick snack. Can't say enough how versatile this sauce is.
