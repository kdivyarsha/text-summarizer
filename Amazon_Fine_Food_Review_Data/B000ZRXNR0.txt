A22V3I98JS37SE	2	Should be much better	3	6	First of all, this is a 10% Kona BLEND, it is not 100% Kona coffee!<br />Second, it is a 7 oz. bag, which is less than 1/2 pound.<br />For the price, you would do better to go direct to the Lion Coffee site. So much for rarity.<br />As for flavor, it's not much better than cafeteria coffee. I found it lacking in aroma and flavor.<br /><br />Granted, the lion is a great looking brand, and it makes a cool souvenir to bring back to friends but, like the Macadamia nuts, it tastes much better in the islands. Save your money and buy a keychain instead. If you're looking for a nice Kona blend, keep looking.
