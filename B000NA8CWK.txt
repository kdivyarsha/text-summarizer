A1ZU33VMBIGLJC	3	Meh..	1	1	"Maybe I'm too picky, but I won't be buying this again. I ordered 3 different items at the same time. The other two have been awesome; this one, not so much. Tried it twice now, using a HEAVY coating the second time. Just has no flavor. I was very disappointed, but the no-salt make up of it still earns it 3 stars. My dad, for whom I cook daily, is salt-restricted, and I thought sure this would be a great way to liven up the weekly chicken dishes. Nope. I wound up dumping the whole bottle into my home-made canister of rub...didn't even change the flavor of that! It was no more than ""filler"" for the home-made stuff, which I guess will at least make it go farther. Like I said, the other stuff I've purchased from these folks is great...I use them almost daily, and am very pleased, but I will stick to making my own rotis-chicken rub."

I've been looking for spice mixes that don't contain salt. now I've found them. i intend to buy others starting with smoked paprika."

AU32T53STZT74	5	Yumm	0	0	Yummy..I cooked my chicken breast in the crock pot with this seasoning. Mmmmmmmmmm....it is so delicious. I also used it on baked chicken. The flavor is so good. Try it you will love it. Great value too.
A2KC8TUNAIUUSK	4	Decent rub for more than just the birds.	0	0	"A handful of people have all commented that this rub is actually quite good on pork steaks and chops, and not just on chicken. It's a decent bulk buy, and it's salt free, so you can control the salinity of the season while still using a ready mix. This is a good bulk buy."
