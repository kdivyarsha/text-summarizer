R1TXTP8GNETALS	4.0	A great entertainment tablet	514	533	I've recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch (the normal, non-Lite version), so it was fun to get to compare that to this Lite version. The Lite is well built... it feels very solid in your hands, with a a textured back instead of the slick plastic back of the non-lite version. I guess the textured back is less expensive, but it also is easier to hold and feels good in the hand. The buttons for volume and standby feel solid and are easy to press (and to know they've been pressed). I like the design, too. It's just the right thickness, and the bezel may be a bit wide but this makes it easier to hold. With a touchscreen, it's annoying if I can't hold the thing without accidentally hitting the screen. The screen itself has a good resolution, but the contrast is definitely not as defined as with the non-lite tablet. This is noticeable when playing darker games or movies. To test performance I installed a few games and played some HD movies. For movie playback, this sucker is rock solid with no frame skipping I could detect. For games like Airplane!, Radiant, Candy Crush, and Angry Birds, this tablet is great, with pretty visuals and a nice size surface for gameplay. For Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, with graphics set to maximum, the framerate was too low for easy gameplay. On medium the game was largely playable, though the frames would suffer somewhat if a lot was happening while driving. I found the game great to play on low graphics (which in my opinion look just fine). I find the performance of the tablet to be fine, but that's worth paying attention to. For comparison, the regular Galaxy Tab 3 performed obviously better on GTA San Andreas on medium, but was pretty similar on max graphics. There was no difference on less demanding games that I could detect. Websites and movies all loaded great on both. For other differences, it only has a 2 megapixel camera on the back, and no cam on the front. Video chatting is a nice feature of the other tablet, but it's not a big deal to me to lose that feature. In fact, if you have concerns about being spied upon, then you might even like the lack of a front facing cam. To sum it up, a 7 inch tablet is just the right size for commuters or lounging on the couch. Everything is easy to read, and there's plenty of room for a screen keyboard, but it's also very easy to hold. Surfing the internet or watching a video on this is great, especially when I ride a bus or train around town. While it's watchable in full sun, the picture will wash out, due to the glossy screen and inferior contrast. Battery life is absolutely fantastic! About nine hours of regular goofing off, and about three-four of playing San Andreas (I keep going back to that because it's by far the most stress I can put on the device). You get a Micro SD slot, so you aren't locked in to any content vendor or the space limitations of the device. That alone makes this better, for me, than an iPad or many of the 'best' android tabs. Swiping to type works great, and S Voice is very handy (though Google Now is great for its own purposes). For example, I can set an alarm without fumbling through the menus, simply by double clicking the front button and saying "set an alarm for eight hours (or the time I want)". That is so much better when you're tired and have taken off your glasses. Android's software library is stout, with a lot of awesome free software, a great browser in chrome, and awesome paid content too. If you haven't had an android device yet, this is an affordable way to get some awesome stuff. If you've only used it on a phone, you will be impressed with how your favorite apps look on a bigger screen. A nice game on a tablet screen puts your old Gameboy days to shame! I did save a map and use this for navigation for a little while. It did a great job, though I really don't need anything that big for the task. While there are better deals out there for a budget tablet, I really like Samsung's build quality and proprietary software (S-Voice, for example). Is that worth the extra money (or alternatively the less powerful processor, depending on what you're comparing this to)? I say it is, but with the current price I would go with the non-Lite Galaxy Tab. I suspect that this product will be more affordable in the near future, so this is one to keep an eye on if you're just wanting an inexpensive way to read e-books and watch media. Others may recommend a more generic branded tablet, which for the money will definitely get you more features and horsepower, but I've learned that the poor man pays twice with these mobile electronics. Get the good brands, and you'll be ahead in the long-run.
R3RR4XI8OCGXE7	3.0	Good for what it is. Could be better.	300	312	What is has: 7.0" 16M-color LCD capacitive touchscreen of 1024x600 pixel resolution; 170 ppi Android OS v4.2.2 with TouchWiz 1.2 GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU, GC1000 GPU, 1GB of RAM, Marvell PXA986 chipset 2 MP autofocus rear facing camera with face detection VGA video recording at 24fps 8 GB internal storage, microSD slot max. 32GB 3G version with voice communication and SMS available - NOT included in this model Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n support GPS with A-GPS connectivity; GLONASS support Stereo Bluetooth v4.0 microUSB port for charging, USB charging cable, wall adapter Accelerometer sensor Standard 3.5 mm audio jack Document editor and file manager comes preinstalled 3600 mAh battery Main disadvantages: No USB OTG support - No HDMI port Low screen resolution-1024x600 Feeble chipset-only 1GB RAM Only one speaker and placed at the back No front-facing camera If you're looking for a compact and inexpensive tablet - one you wouldn't worry about getting lost or damaged - this is as good a choice as any. This tablet is a stripped down version of the Galaxy Tab 3. Want to use SKYPE? Sorry, no front facing camera. Want to attach a USB stick, mouse or keyboard? Sorry, no USB OTG support. The tablet is extremely basic, primarily for tasks like reading and sending email, reading a book or magazine, watching Netflix or streaming music. The tablet works ok for what it is and I get about 6-9 hours out of the battery before recharge depending upon how I am using it. The tablet will work well as a travel tablet, or one for the kids to use. Just don't expect too much of it. Competition: The ASUS MeMo Pad HD7 costs the same as the Samsung tablet but has better screen resolution, faster quad-core processor, front camera, higher-res rear camera and is lighter. The Lenovo IdeaTab A3000 matches the Lite in all aspects: display size and resolution, Android version, battery but adds a front camera, better rear camera, USB OTG and a more powerful processor at the expense of a little extra thickness and weight. Again, not a bad tablet for the price, but there are other tablets available with better specs for the same money. If this tablet were priced between $100 and $120, it would be a good deal. At $150+, it's just too expensive for what you get.
R11K51TKBN934O	1.0	The tablet was working fine and charging correctly at night	156	166	After 2 weeks of attempting to get my Samsung Tab 3 warrantied I am told tonight by Willy in Consumer Relations that "there is nothing Samsung can do to repair my tablet", incessantly sighting Physical damage as the cause. The tablet was working fine and charging correctly at night, in the morning it would not turn on or charge. I took two pictures of the charging port showing there was no physical damage prior to shipping it to the repair centre, as I was expecting to be brushed off citing physical damage, as is common with consumer electronics. Willy insisted that there was no way their service centre could have damaged the unit and stated that it was "obviously my fault". I was treated extremely poorly and I still do not have my tablet back, however the service centre will fix it for a fee. When I asked to speak to someone else, I was told "there was no one else to speak with" which I find hard to believe that Willy is solely handling all of the Samsung inbound calls on his own. Buyer beware: Samsung does not honour their warranties and cites physical damage as a reason.
R2D4GK6K52MRKL	2.0	Software update removed Play Store compatibility	53	57	Purchased as a gift for my daughter. The product description indicates Google Play Store compatibility. Out of the box, this is true, but one of the software updates removed the Play Store icon. When I tried Play Games to install games from Google, I received a message that the device was not compatible with some Play services and I should contact the manufacturer. Almost none of the games I wanted for my daughter were in the Samsung store. Not having Google Play is a deal-killer for me.
RQG4AD64FS1Y1	5.0	Breaking News: Apple Fanboy Goes Android	34	37	Let me start this out by saying I never thought I would own an Android tablet. Ever. I have been an Apple fan since 2005. Since then I have owned 2 iPods, 3 iPhones, 2 Macbook Pros, and 1 iPad. I'm extremely clumsy and constantly drop things. I accidentally dropped my first iPod down a flight of stairs and it still worked. I found Apple to be sturdy and reliable in their products... until now. My iPad, or as I like to call it "Sir Crash-a-lot," has been the tablet from hell. It worked great for a year but then it started dying. I've owned Sir Crash-a-lot for three years now. I have spent three years trying to save up for a newer iPad. But after saving for three years to replace Sir Crash-a-lot, I vowed to never buy an iPad again. Instead I went out and did something no Apple fanboy has ever done: I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab. What drove me to buy this tablet? Apple's unreliability. Sure, my iPad's apps ran slowly. Sure, the apps crashed a lot. But the final straw came when iTunes decided my Apple account should no longer be associated with my library, should be split into two parts (old email address & new email address), and should not be linked to my iPad. Oh, I should also mention iTunes deleted a ton of music I bought from my tablet because "You do not have permission to access the following file(s)." After almost 10 years of being an Apple fanboy, I went online and searched for Android tablets. Since I knew several people who loved their Samsung Galaxy phones, I went with the only tablet I could afford: a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite. Shortly after taking it out of the box, I realized how great this tablet is. Even though the size was quiet a downgrade (I'm near-sighted and like to use my tablet without my reading glasses) I have had no problems reading text on it. The screen has better color than my iPad or my husband's iPad Mini. The screen switches quicker and loads faster than any iOS device I've ever seen. I love all of the customization that comes standard on Android. Even with all of its great features that I have grown to love, this tablet isn't without its problems. Most of the problems that come with it that people talk about is either the slow processor or the speaker being on the back. Neither of those are a huge problem for me. My biggest problem is the standard memory. Out of the 8gb, over 2gb are taken up by the operating system and the bloatware apps that I'll never use (and can't remove). After installing all of the apps I use regularly, I only have 2gb of space left. That's not much space. Thankfully, it has expandable memory. After I get a good 64gb micro SD card (my old one was corrupted), I plan on moving some of the big apps onto the card and putting my music library on it. The longer I have this tablet, the more I wish I bought it instead of an iPad for my first tablet. For anyone who's looking at getting this tablet, you will need the following: 1. An impact-resistant silicone case to absorb the shock of any falls the tablet will experience. 2. A tempered glass screen protector to prevent the screen from breaking. 3. A 64gb micro SD card to store most of your music, photos, and apps.
R3A0HET9JDNQ	3.0	You will be much happier with the Non-Lite version!	111	131	Bought and returned. Decided I couldn't live with the single speaker facing towards the back. Picked up the Regular Tab 3 which has a better build, better components, a front facing camera and two speakers on the bottom. You also get a much better screen. The screen of the Lite is of cheaper material and you can see faint horizontal lines built into the clear display. It kept developing streaks/smears on the screen (I believe due to the heat of the display) which I had to constantly wipe off. The Lite also took forever and a day to recharge the battery. The only thing I will miss with the Lite version is the Jelly Bean 4.2 OS which has gesture typing and the ability to store some apps on a external micro SD card. The lite is priced too high and should go down once it's been on the market for awhile.
R2XAOP4O2TT2I1	1.0	NO FRONT CAMERA!!!!	28	31	THE PICTURE CLEARLY SHOWS A HOME SCREEN CAMERA BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE ONE. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS AT ALL. I AM CONSIDERING SENDING THIS ONE BACK AND BUYING ONE AT A STORE THAT I CAN SEE AND KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING. BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR THE PRICE BUT IT IS NOT WORTH IT.... SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INVEST IN A GOOD TABLE THAT HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU WANT!!
R1F5ZAUCP4KDVG	4.0	Great as an intro tablet	18	20	For being my first tablet, I love it. But the memory space is so small that it fills up too quickly. I'd much advise any buyer purchasing a MicroSD card post haste. I've got several games and books on mine, and I'm in serious need of a memory expansion card now. -.- Still, good buy.
RHFFGVJH0IWTD	5.0	good so far, but make sure you don't press buttons accidentally	13	14	I was about to send this tablet back as defective because, nearly every day, it would spontaneously and repeatedly reboot itself and the volume would automatically drop to zero. It was essentially unusable. Then, I noticed that the way it was sitting in my tablet stand, the power and volume buttons were at the bottom, and the weight of the tablet may have been causing the buttons to be pressed unintentionally. I've since flipped the tablet around and have no longer had the auto-reboot and sound disappearing problems. The tablet now works great. The only slight disappointment I've found with this tablet is that, as mentioned by other reviewers, it does not have support for USB OTG. So, I was unable to use an external USB keyboard that I plugged in. I did, however, successfully pair and use a Jelly Comb Universal Bluetooth Keyboard Ultra Slim with this tablet. Considering that this external keyboard cost less than $15 including shipping, I don't mind not being able to use the USB keyboard. Overall, I'm very happy with this tablet.
R39BW2X0I0ZX4K	5.0	Surprisingly great tablet for a low price	9	9	This is overall a great tablet. I am a college freshman and I love that I will be able to load some of my textbooks on here as e-books and not only save money but not have to worry about carrying a textbook or my bulky laptop around campus. The display is pretty good with decent screen resolution. I had previously purchased a $100 Toshiba tablet from Best Buy and within 2 weeks I returned it because I had issues with wi-fi connectivity and could not stand the poor screen resolution. I am so glad I did so because for just $40 more, I have a tablet that I completely love and can see myself using everyday.

We were dis	6	6	I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite for my daughter. My other daughter already had a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (regular) that she loves so I figured the 3 Lite would be fine. We were disappointed however and had to return the Galaxy 3 Tab Lite as there were a couple games that would not run on the Lite that run fine on the old Tab 2. Most games did work, just not all. When you click to run the game the screen would black out for a period of time before returning to the home screen. After returning it we bought a regular Galaxy Tab 4 and she couldn't be happier. All the games run fine and it works like a charm. I would recommend getting a normal version of the Galaxy Tab and stay away from the Lite version.
RC4OLLGV1PZ89	4.0	Loved it!	8	9	This is a pretty good tablet. It is very fast and very simple to use. It is the perfect size of screen to watch movies and play games. The battery lost last a long time and doesn't take long to charge. It is portable and light.
R7I82O98H296D	5.0	Five Stars	9	10	It was very good
R36JO28AB48OO6	5.0	Better than a kindle fire!	4	4	Bought this to replace my kindle fire. There is no repair on kindles. I'd you don't buy the extended warranty you must replace it if the screen breaks. This does everything my kindle does and can be repaired if I break the screen by dropping it! Price is also better than a kindle fire.
R3H6MBB1H9NFKG	3.0	Ok for what it is...	5	6	The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite is a decent tablet but could be a lot better. Cons: - The resolution: While it's pretty good, it's not great. 1024x600 will not give you the bright, vibrant on screen colors that we've come to expect with today's tablets. - Outdated software: The tablet comes with Android 4.2, Jelly Bean OS. Being that as of 2014, the latest Android version is 4.4, Kit Kat, that is unacceptable for a device that came out this year. - The battery life is only average: Be prepared to possibly carry a charger around with you, especially if you're a heavy user. - Only 1GB of ram: This will make running many programs on this device slow it down quite a bit. - 2mp camera: Though I doubt too many people will be using this device to take pictures on a regular basis, 2mp is still low especially in this day in age. It's ok in a pinch though I suppose. - Rear speakers: This seems to be an issue with many Samsung devices. They love putting their speakers on the back so if the device is resting on a flat surface, the sound gets muzzled. Pros: - Slim, compact and lightweight: Because of this, it makes this device very portable and easy to manage. - Good images and text: Despite the low resolution of the screen, images still look pretty good and the text is clear - Fast: Only provided that you don't have many programs running in the background. See above. Despite the affordable price, you might be better off with the regular Tab 3. This device is the "Lite" version so of course you will not get all of the bells and whistles and it may not run optimally because of it's low specs. However, if you're looking for a brand name, no frills tablet, this one is for you.
RDF288LDZK61F	5.0	Great Tablet	3	3	Bought this for my 5 yr old grand-daughter, make sure you get a silicone case for it.in case it drops..The day she dropped it and busted the glass was the same day the case got delivered..she broke it in the morning case came in the afternoon. Luckily I had bought the insurance plan for it..and it was replaced with no problem, very easy to use.. Even my grandson who is 2 uses it with no problems at all..The battery lasts a decent amount of time..It even takes good pictures..I just wish it had a dual camera...Besides that It was a great buy for this family
R2W8F5U6UVCSQ8	5.0	durable	3	3	More durable than the ipad and the reason why I say that its becuase I just dropped my tablet about an hor ago and thats the third time and haven't got a scratch or dent but when I had my ipad which was a year ago had fallen from 2 feet and the whole screen cracked i was so desapointed at apple .
R33FB8X2XZDEPE	1.0	Send it to the Moon	14	19	This is a crap product. Do not buy it. Too many battery issues. If you GOOGLE this product you will see the same thing. I bought this product without researching it since my son wanted it. We had to replace it, and now the second one fails!!! He cannot use it at school due to the constant shutting down. Bought an Apple Ipad Mini instead, even though it costs much more. If I sound too strong about this, just trying save you some trouble.
R2CFFLXBWLL3L8	5.0	Good little tablet.	3	3	Great. Love it. It's my kitchen buddy. Runs my sonos speakers, displays my recipes, and hangs out with me while I am cooking. Everyone needs an extra tablet just for the little things.
RT6V2BPQD6BHD	5.0	Best deal for the money!	5	6	I have had my new tablet for approximately three months now, and I LOVE IT! A great tool that works well with everything! Auto sync, speak type, massive apps, and so much more......best deal for the money!
R1K6SD88CS2Y61	5.0	WORKS LIKE A CHARM!	2	2	I ordered mine without realizing it was the lite version but it works like a charm. I have experience with several tablets and I previously had two Galaxy Tab 1st generation and they worked marvelously well, and this tablet is no exception. I love the perfomance and design not to mention the awesome color!. I am a designer and I use it for showing my work to clients but I do have a lot of apps and they all work great!. The only thing to mention is that the camera on the back is not that great and it has no camera on front. Other than that I really love it! I really recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a low price brand tablet. Mind you, you should get the proper case for it since the camera is in a different position compared to the normal Galaxy Tab 3.

R22P2G5HWL6J28	3.0	Good product. Details on the description are incorrect	2	2	Product looks good and works good. My only major complaint is that the description advertises 64 gb expandle memory through a micro sd. Upon receiving the item i found out it only accepts 32 gb and smaller micro cards. This wouldn't normally be a problem but i ordered the 64 gb micro sd card when i ordered the tablet. So i ended up with an unnecessary hastle and waste of money... three stars for unaccurate details in the description and no easy way to contact to resolve. I will keep the product either way
RQ0V0NDGK7CH9	4.0	It is a very nice tablet. I do like it	2	2	It is a very nice tablet. I do like it. I do not care for the on/off button, which must be pressed down for a few seconds instead of just a quick press. Takes a while to start up. That could definitely be improved. I didn't pay $300-400 for it, either, so those things I overlook most of the time. I am not getting the battery life out of it that was advertised, however. That I do not like about it. I would have given it five stars if not for that.
R3AVM5P9LTGO6	1.0	Not a great purchase for me	13	18	Sorry, but this particular Samsung Tablet 3 wasn't for me. It had a boot startup time of just over four minutes, even after I turned off selected startup programs. Any changes, such as clearing the cache, did not speed up performance. I like Samsung, and I have a Samsung Tablet 2 and it works great, with a startup time of less than two minutes. I received it yesterday returned this Tab 3 to the vendor of purchase today.
RX6U4G88X0ECG	1.0	Very very cheaply made.	21	30	I own Samsung GT-P6200 Galaxy Tab (couple of years old). I was given a new Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite as a present few weeks ago. This NEWER Lite version is much much worse than my OLD GT-P6200 tablet in EVERY category. Sound is bad, you can't really enjoy playing music, video is not that good, I don't want to watch movies on it. When I tried to make my own video, it was all grainy, grey, low quality, smaller size, not whole screen, sound was horrible, some cracking and scratching on the background. Photos are also no good. Just makes you upset when you try to make a picture of a beautiful sunset and instead you get something bleak and flat on the screen. In general it is cheaply made. Even USB cable that came with it is shorter, cheaper, and stiffer in comparison with the GT-P6200. No earphones in the box. No front camera so no video chat. Or turn it around and they will see you but you will not see them. They tried to make it as cheap as possible cutting costs on every corner. Tablet has only three home screens and some kind of Android system with the simplified functionality. I don't know what to use this tablet for, maybe just to read books or to have it as an external hard drive. I keep it as a backup in case my regular tablet gets discharged. It doesn't break but it doesn't give you a real pleasure of using it either. Just an annoyance. For its functionality I would price is around $50-$60 when new. It's more than TWICE OVERPRICED, it is no good even for a school kid. My advice is to spend a little bit more money and buy something better.

Slightly less powerful than the regular Tab 3 but sturdier and with textured backing. Perfect for the beginner/intermediate Android user on a Wi-Fi signal. Does not have "selfie" camera on front which may put some people off. Also does not support 3G/4G. Great price point and features. Kinda hard to find a case too.
R38AP9GUPS6BZM	2.0	regular Galaxy Tab 3 is better than Galaxy Tab 3 Lite	15	21	Galaxy tab 3 is way better than this lite version. I would recommend to save your money and go for Galaxy Tab 3 not Galaxy Tab 3 Lite. The rear camera is very bad. It has a lot of lag. No front camera. The design definitely feels cheaper compare to the regular Galaxy Tab 3. I should have read the reviews before buying.

Opening Google Inbox and any other app at the same time will kill the OS. It's a good tablet for kids or people that doesn't have access to another more expensive device.

R2ZXE72BLTHX6R	1.0	Screen is not Samsung expected	10	14	I just hate it. The screen changes colors, and is only visible at certain angles, which I think is it's major flaw. I own a SG S4, and it just looks as if this was a low end not branded chinese product you could get for 50 bucks. Just annoys me to think I bought it.
R3GKWRKD8ITKZN	2.0	I visited Best Buy for an answer and they told me to ...	3	4	unable to remove books purchased and downloaded to Play Books. I have visited You Tube Samsung Galaxy 3 Tablet and this information is not address. I visited Sears Store on September 19th and they were unable to answer my question on the removal of books purchased and downloaded on the App Play Books. I visited Best Buy for an answer and they told me to visit Barnes and Noble Book Store. I spent nearly two hours researching three books at Barnes and Noble on Samsung Galaxy 3 Tablet to no avail. Our Home Owner Association in Sun City West, AZ is going to have a class on Tablets on November 17th and 24th of which I have signed up for. Perhaps I will find an answer to my problem. It is a sad day when an organization like Samsung manufactures a product and markets a product without instruction on the operation of their products. Floyd E.

R1KNJI8A1E136L	5.0	Great Tablet!	1	1	I bought this tablet for my 9 yr old son, because I had previously bought a similar tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 kids version the yellow one) for my 4 yr old son and they would constantly fight over it. This tablet does all what he expected. All the games he wanted in google playstore and it connected easily to my home wifi. It is sturdy and the back is easier to grip not that glossy finish like most Samsung devices. I love that it has a color detail at the back which makes it kinda kid fun looking, However I will still be buying the case for it in the same color. The only disadvantage is no front camera and the camera quality could be better but overall a great tablet!
R2O7PRKYDBCQGI	5.0	I love this tablet!	1	1	I am very impressed with this affordable tablet! Works like dream for the purposes I bought it for - audio books, music, Facebook ebooks and so much more! For me personally it' s the perfect size. I've been using an iPod, but because of my declining vision, I can see everything so much better on this size screen without having to enlarge pages and then having to scroll all over the place to see them.I also have a much easier time with the keyboard as my hands have nerve damage, arthritis and tremors. So again, this is a wonderful little tablet for a really good price! Oh and it also has a a slot for a miniSD card for the extra memory space you might need :)
R1CQ6BP3HRVJ4I	3.0	Ok tablet	1	1	Bought this after my toddler pulled our old tablet into the bathtub, he is the main user. I like the size of this tablet, it fits well in his lap and isn't too big for him to carry around. I love kids mode, but wish i could add more than 30 apps for him, and wish he had access to movies/shows through google app. I expected the functional quality of this to be better however, the tablet freezes at least once a day and certain apps I can't even download onto it as it says they "aren't compatible". This tablet isn't old or outdated, so I don't understand why certain apps wouldn't be compatible. Overall it works well for its purpose of entertaining a 2 year old.
RPHUDIO39YUYU	5.0	Ditch your laptop	3	4	This is my first tablet. I have a Galaxy Note II smartphone, looks/works just like the tablet. I sometimes need to VPN to work while travelling. In the past I've used my phone and carried a small laptop. Now I can ditch the laptop. I was not able to read some Amazon books on my laptop using Kindle app, presumably due to copyrights/licensing. I can now do this on my tablet. I was trying to decide between a Kindle 7 HD and this tablet and decided on this tablet due to my familiarity with the Galaxy and remote tools that I need for work. No regrets...
R1BG1L91DMYY1Q	5.0	Great Gift for a Child	1	1	Ordered this for my 6 year old step son. His hands aren't quite big enough yet to hold an iPad or a bigger sized Galaxy Tab. This is a great gift for a kid who constantly wants to watch YouTube videos and play games on. Verly lightweight and far better quality build than those cheap no name brand tablets sold at retail stores. The screen isn't great but for children who a prone to dropping things, I think it's a safe bet to have this for them.
ROVOE5ARTBL19	5.0	excellent product	1	1	We bought two of these for our kids and absolutely love them. We previously had RCA tablets and they were awful. One of my favorite features is the kids app that came installed on it. This set up a super easy interface for the kids that we could control and not have to worry about what they are accessing. It even allows you to set a time limit if you want to restrict the amount of time they are using it. Anyway, great for kids and adults.
R163NZPL8G6290	5.0	First tablet	1	1	Did my research carefully. I do not game so the features of the tab 3 lite meet my needs well. Use it to be on social media, check email and access the internet. The tablet is primarily used at home where I have access to the internet via wireless router. Can't beat it for $99. For the tablet, a cover and a sd card I paid $134. There is no access to mobile networks so evaluate your needs before deciding on a tablet
R1TX6Z320JDW0I	5.0	only thing i dislike about the tablet is that if you tilt it ...	1	1	had the regular samsung galaxy tablet 3 so i already knew what to expect when getting another tablet. only thing i dislike about the tablet is that if you tilt it a certain way, its like a plasma tv, the screen gets dark one way and super light the other. and right side up is normal. other than that its a great tablet, i got mine for like 80 bucks from here and its pretty damn worth it.
R10Z5QAOMZ4W8K	5.0	Samsung Galaxy Tab Lite.	1	1	Great product and great price ! Easy too set up and use. I would recommend this Tablet it to others.
R2DPIJ39RZNIQ	3.0	read before buying	1	1	This product is ok if your not looking for a tablet to play music out loud because it has one speaker and it on the back. Its internet speed compared to the non lite version is slightly fast but they are about equal. The color on this version also looks washed out compared to the non lite version. Gaming on each is equal. So my conclusion is that if you plan on watching movies listening to music and want a tablet with a front camera I would pay a little extra for the non lite version.
R3T8SNDVNW66ZV	4.0	Great!	1	1	I bought this tablet for my parents for Christmas, and they absolutely love it. Having no experience at all with tablets or smartphones, they actually both caught on really quick. The size is a little small and the quality is not as good as my iPad Air, but for beginners or for someone who doesn't use the device a lot, this is perfect.
R1094B0K46IZTP	5.0	Great Tablet	3	4	Got this for my mom. It comes with the Tablet, 1 Wall Adapter, 1 USB charge cable. She loves it, she says it's her stress relief, many nights she's up late playing games lol. So far, no problems, everything thing in working order, just wish I had gotten her one with a bigger screen.
R3NIOEA2N20D9F	3.0	Good tablet when it works	0	0	In November 2013 I purchased three Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lites. Two for my kids and the other as a gift. I haven't heard any complaints about the gifted tablet so I am assuming it is working well. So my two children have one each. One is working well whilst the other one started exhibiting problems straight out of the box. The first problem it had is that it didn't stay connected to WiFi. My other child's tablet would stay connected whilst one of them would be kicked off. Then within 5-6 months of purchase another problem showed up. That it didn't charge properly. The tablet would be left to charge for hours or overnight and later show that it only charged a few percent. Anyway, in November 2014, the day before the warranty expired, the tablet shut down completely and I couldn't turn it on at all. I couldn't do a hard reset or anything. I contacted Samsung customer support who were very helpful, and because it was still within warranty I was given a tracking number and UPS label via email. I sent it for repairs for free. It was fixed for free and it was returned for free. It even worked better than before it was sent for repairs. However, that was about 3-4 weeks ago. Then 24 hours ago the tablet started playing up again and it is back to it's old tricks and not charging properly. The tablet was left overnight on charge (about 12 hours) and it only charged 9%. I'm not sure what to do now since it is out of the warranty period. Other cons about the tablet: 8 GB is not a lot. The tablet comes with apps which take up about 4 GB. So you only have 4 GB of useable memory. Another time I asked Samsung customer support about downloading movies on to an SD card and I was told movies download to the hard drive due to copyright issues. Now I don't know if music and books also download to the hard drive, but if you want to download books, music and movies 4GB is not enough. Pro: Price is good. You can expand the memory with an SD card, but that isn't useful if you want to save movies. Overall if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet this is a decent tablet, but do yourselves a favor and buy one with largest memory you can. 4GB gets used up pretty fast. Also, I hope you get a tablet that works!!! I own an iPad mini, my sister has had her full size iPad for three years. My mother has had her full size iPad for two years, and we have never had a problem. I'm not an Apple enthusiast nor do I work for them, my cell phone is an Android phone and I'm not looking to change it to an Apple phone, but if I cannot get my son's Tab 3 fixed for free (it is outside the warranty period) I would be very tempted not to buy a Samsung again.
R3DQ2DYREYDR7E	5.0	Good bang for the buck	1	1	Really nice tablet for the price. Very reliable and easy to use. Battery life is reasonable and there are lots of apps that you can get, many of them free. This tablet does a super job of surfing the web, streaming movies, and playing games.
R20RV8P96U459U	4.0	You get what you pay for.	1	1	I bought the tablet for school purpose and so far I'm happy with my purchase. The battery life is good but the down side is, it takes forever to charge. And after two weeks I had to replace the charger.
R1NA4EXF05BIV9	5.0	amazing performance and great HQ display	1	1	The performance of the tablet of samsung is really smooth. i have been playing soul calibur in this and it is a great game made greater with astounding graphics thanks to this tablet's HQ display
R2DIWJXE9UJDTT	4.0	Good so far.	1	1	Enjoying this tablet, there are a few things I would change about the settings and I would add a front camera. All in all, it's better than other similar products I have tried.
R2CKBFNSFARTB6	4.0	If your needs are "Light," or first tablet, this will do fine	0	0	For starters, this is a "Light" tablet, not having a full range of features that a moderate or high end tablet would have. But then there's the price. Having had a tablet that had features akin to a moderate level tablet - HDMI output, for example - but whose battery now takes days to charge after about 3 years use, I knew which features I really used a lot, and which were quite optional. "Light" made better sense since I'm a very casual user with a particular range of not-very-demanding expectations, lightweight games, e-reader, email, Facebook, basic office-type programs, and some other convenience apps. I shouldn't spend over $100 if that's all I'm going to utilize it. The battery is adequate; charges quickly and also discharges rather quickly. It sometimes knocks me out of apps for no apparent reason, and I've had to use its Restart feature to get good operability back after extended use, but those are pretty minor issues. It's just fine for this lazy old booger in the recliner who is done with most of the day's office work, wraps up a few things, and plays a game, checks the scores, and then takes his e-reader to bed after setting the alarm to wake him up for another day in paradise.
R7M4YFARKVWY1	5.0	tab 3 lite	5	7	I love my new tablet. It fits perfectly in my hand and bag. Very clear screen. I found the price to be very reasonable for the excellent product I received!
RLJVGZHQNDX3K	4.0	Nice tablet	1	1	I bought this for use in an organization that I belong to and like it because it is easy to use and has better quality than many other tables in the same price range.
RBZGAJ1T02ZJV	5.0	Galaxy does it again!	2	2	My 5 year old loves it!
R2DMDL2QVDQ9KZ	3.0	Samsung vs Apple.	0	0	I just purchased this tablet yesterday from Walmart. This is my first Samsung product, I usually stick with Apple. I really like the texture on the back. It makes it easier to hold, a lot of times I feel that my iPad and iPhone are going to slide right out of my hand when I don't have the case on. I felt, going with a name brand product, that I would have similar quality to an iPad but this tab is a lot slower than I expected it to be. So far I've only downloaded a couple games to test it out but it takes 5+ seconds for the apps to open from when you touch them, this is something I've never had happen with with my iPad. It's not a huge issue, just an observation. The screen looks amazing and although it is a little on the slow side, I haven't had any real issues playing. It takes longer to switch levels in angry birds but the game-play is fine. I think that I prefer a larger tablet but for the screen size, it's easy to read. I've had a few issues where I've tried to click on one thing and it selected another. All in all, it's okay. I mostly bought it for my kids to play with. I would recommend spending the extra and getting an iPad.

RYQS3MI0W4LEA	4.0	This tab is great for anyone who needs a tab for surfing	1	1	This tab is great for anyone who needs a tab for surfing, social media and online functions. I am glad I bought it. It meets all my online needs.
R1ZATST1PS55SJ	5.0	Good buy	1	1	Works great, mine came without any scratches on the front or back just a couple small chips around the side that are barely even noticeable.
RIAVUDL076YYP	5.0	Excellent for the price.	1	1	Bought this for my mom and she loves it. No forward facing camera and the viewing angles aren't great, but it works perfectly for her needs.
R1VOYD1H2RBTK5	4.0	Works as advertised	1	1	Works as well as the Galaxy Tab 3. Is slightly larger so none of the cases made for the Galaxy Tab 3 fit. Finding a case can be difficult.
R3MC65N6ZTQFP3	5.0	great tab	3	4	Got this for the kids to break in, so far no problems. Works fast and battery is great. Excellent camera too. No complaints.
R3U5GEHR4LQQ1C	5.0	Very good!	5	7	What can I say? I only buy samsung products, very good quality as always, and the price is reasonable, thank you.
R1WW9JY2YISWTA	5.0	Perfect book size	8	12	I loaded the Kindle app and the Samsung Galaxy tab lite is the perfect book size to take on a trip and read at night. It fit in my coat pocket or backpack pocket. Of course it has all the other tablet features so you can use the wifi settings at hotels, libraries, cafes etc to check email and facebook and keep up with the world. My phone does all the same things but the screen is too small - the tab is the perfect size. And airlines now offer wifi to use on the plane and SW airlines even offers movies if you bring your own device so the galaxy gets lots of use. And Amazon was $10 cheaper than Staples for the same device and the cases for it are $30 cheaper on Amazon.
RTPDCQIQQJCPD	5.0	Absolutely wonderful, can't tell the difference from the Tab 3	1	1	Absolutely wonderful, can't tell the difference from the Tab 3. Bought it for my 6yr old, he loves it. Samsung all the way.

R3DPV9IUUTXEXO	4.0	Cheap but works well enough for basic needs	2	3	Bought two of these for my kids, though 1 is the kid version that comes with a rubber case. Pros: Works good for popular apps/games Decent recording pictures and video Good battery life Can add micro memory so 8gb internal memory is not an issue Cons: A lot of software crashes compared to my apple products TFT screen/display is just tolerable Internal speaker is barely audible in a busy house like mine. Kids have to use headphones for movies. Chipset/processor is a little weak. As a result... ...Video playback is slow and grainy ...Internet browsing is slow and awkward If my kids were older I would have spent more for a pad4 or better. But for a $100-120 I got what I paid for.
R3ALOA911MXO1	5.0	Great tablet, great price.	0	0	Great entry level tablet. Fits in your hands very nicely. Not overly bulky or heavy. It's light and comfortable! Fast enough to do normal every day tasks. May not be great for process/graphic heavy games but that is not a problem for us. Still able to multi task and runs apps just fine! Screen reselution isn't as crisp and sharp as newer tab's or phones but still pleasant to look at. And honestly you don't really notice while using it. Text is clear and easy to read. Haven't had any issues with it yet. For the price it is a great tablet! Gave it to my son as a gift for his birthday and he hasn't put it down since... not sure if that's good or bad yet but either way he loves the tab! (he's 11 for anyone wondering for gift ideas). Very satisfied. Only thing that could've made this better is front facing camera.
RAWBP1FV3KB9N	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	Thank you for such a wonderful transaction!! Love the tablet and the charger!! Will purchase from in the future!
R2ON459MT3KSN5	4.0	Four Stars	1	1	It's great. Here's in seoul korea. so irony...uhm Samsung GalTab .. It's very simple and convenient .
RQX0RQXSRE5J7	5.0	Love it (:	0	0	Tablet overall works well. When I first got it I plugged it in, turned it on, and when it kept updating. Like probably four times before I was like, "okay something is wrong." I googled it real quick and it was because for some reason it can't update (at least the inital update) while plugged in. Also, I have a galaxy phone too so I was using that charger for the tablet and the tablet kept dying really fast without even being used so I googled that too, and sure enough it was because I wasn't using the charger it came with even though they were the same. Long story short, I love it. Buy a good case. I'm not sure what's so "lite" about it, this is my first tablet and I can't think if anything that it's missing, besides a front facing camera, so no snapchat.
R1AWPWFL6UYO8E	2.0	Two Stars	1	1	the tablet was fine physically, but does not come with front camera and the description does not say ..
R216A6PYLTXVEH	4.0	Nothing better for the $$$	6	9	For all you complaining about the features: Yeah, the screen is a little cheaper, so is the speaker. That's the only things I found bad about the tablet. $140? That's a steal. It runs fast, touch response is even faster. I don't even use the speaker, my Bluetooth headphones work exceptionally, no glitching or whatsoever. The screen is lacking a little contrast and vivid colors, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, because 5 isn't honest and it's not perfect. If I could I would give it a 4.7.
R31ZUQU91V9B6F	1.0	Worst purchase ever.	2	3	This is the worst product I've purchased in a long time. The screen is not intuitive so I have to hit it jussssst right to navigate on pages. By the time it sensed that I was hitting the button to upload a picture to design Christmas cards, the page had timed out. This happened 3 times before I said screw it. Typing is awful because some parts of the screen are more sensitive than others, so it's just a mess. It prompts a software update no less than once daily. The Google Drive on this thing is basically useless. This thing sucks and I wish I hadn't bought it. I should have just put on my big-girl pants and bought an iPad.
R2HNZMLFPGHTGN	5.0	cool	0	0	bought this 'used, like new' and it came in a brand new box with plastic still on it and the cords. looked brand new like it came right off the shelf. I suspect it was bought then returned, making it used. I don't know, all I know is that I am happy with my purchase. its an older model so not all the newer apps are compatible with this (Microsoft word app), but the picture is still HD, it runs fast and has plenty of storage (I also reccomend buying an SD card to avoid cluttering the tablet with random music, pics, and documents). it took ages to get here (came thru FedEx, soooo unbelievably slow! I feel USPS would've been a better choice), but I was very satisfied with my purchase.
R2G9TR0NHLZMXF	5.0	Good First Tablet.	0	0	I ordered this refurbished from the seller Ocean Reef Electronics and I'm pretty happy with it overall. The tablet arrived a lot earlier than the shipping estimate, looks brand new, and works great. I will say if your looking for a high end tablet, this device isn't for you... There is a bit of lag here and there, especially if you have more than 2-3 apps running at once. The lag is improved upon after some software updates from Samsung, but it definitely won't blow you away preformance-wise. However, if you're like me just need something affordable to read ebooks, browse the web, watch Netflix/YouTube, play some casual games on, etc., look no further.
R36AZD7P5G8104	5.0	Five Stars	1	1	My kids are obsessed! Worth the money! Make sure to get at least a 32gb memory card.
R23HJ5V9KW7Q77	5.0	I love it!	0	0	This tablet has made me a fan of Samsung products. I love my tablet so much that I bought a new Samsung Galaxy phone for myself for Christmas last year. I will also continue to buy Samsung products in the future. My tablet runs smoothly, has tons of storage space, and is perfect for what I use it for, which is emails, social media, and watching TV online. I'm sure there are people out there who want a tablet for fancier stuff, and that's okay. Not sure how this one rates. But it's a lot more inexpensive than the others and it's a Droid, which I prefer. So, for me, it's perfect.
RGCYCR979QMAT	4.0	Quality low cost no frills tab. Great for small hands	2	3	Great $100 tablet for kids. My daughter has the original tab 3 with 4G from Sprint. I wanted a step up from the no name tabs at cvs, walgreens, target, etc. But could not justify more than $100 for a kid. This seems like a decent compromise. The only difference here is WiFi only, a little less speed and less memory. Also no front facing camera, but my 8 year old really doesn't need to take a lot of selfies. It works great for his games and the size is perfect for small hands.
R1D7A30WLWVKEC	4.0	I love this tablet	0	0	I love this tablet. Exactly what I was looking for however in the description it says that one of the Galaxy Perks is 3 months of Hulu Plus, this is untrue. I loaded it and signed up, and have never had Hulu before. It gives you a one week free trial then charges you. Other than that everything was exactly as advertised and it is a very nice tablet. The picture quality is a 4 out of 5. The sound with headphones is very nice also 4 out of 5. I love the way the tablet functions but made mine even better with a great case and Bluetooth keyboard combo.
RQETG030JMSYV	1.0	Not upgradable to Kitkat 4. 4. 4, ...	0	0	Not upgradable to Kitkat 4.4.4, despite many reports saying it would. It might be true for other Tab 3 Lite versions (yes, there are many versions!), but this Amazon/US version (Model# SM-T110) is certainly not updatable to Kitkat. Basically you'll be stuck with the outdated Jelly Bean 4.2.2, and according to a Samsung rep I chatted with online, there is no plans for supporting the US version with a newer OS. And yeah, my wife has a non-US version of this tablet, and it was upgradable to Kitkat since Day 1.
R1ZQ5I83XVHTBR	5.0	Great	1	1	This table let is all my daughter ever wanted she loves it thank you
R20174M9HPWSEA	5.0	Will do the the trick!	0	0	I purchased this for travel only after my computer screen was cracked during a flight (long story) and had to buy a new laptop. I am not computer savvy, but played around with it.. Went to Best Buy for their Samsung tablet classes and found out that I needed class two as I had already set up everything in class one. I only need this to check my E-mails and bank account when traveling. I am not a gamer. Found a case for it on Amazon and am ready to carry this instead of my heavy laptop on my next trip.

They got a cheaper off brand tablet a year or two ago and it wouldn't hold a charge, had barely any memory, and a whole host of limiting issues. So they got these this past Christmas and love them! They're playing games and making little movies with their Barbies. The Samsung tablets have excellent memory & charge/battery life. They're also durable enough for kids. If you can get a good deal on it, it would make a great gift!

R39KBS1G63EM2N	1.0	horrible product	0	0	this is a piece of crap... i ordered this thinking it would be great to have a work and since i got i, ive had problems, when i tired to return it, i was told i couldn't, didn't realize that every company on amazon can have their own return policy, if i would have know that i would have never order from this company. oh and samsung has been no help... battery doesn't last more than a couple of hours and apps drop after 5 mins of using them..
R33683DIYD8B9R	5.0	My Galaxy Tab 3	2	3	I purchased this tablet for my business but couldn't download the applications that I needed. So I decided to make it my personal tablet. It's much lighter than my iPad2 and does everything my iPad does without some of the restrictions. I just toss it in my purse and go without the added weight. I would definitely recommend to everyone and I have. I rec'd my tablet within 4 business days in which I was pleasantly surprised. I don't need my tablet to take pictures so the picture quality doesn't matter to me. Great product!
REVWKOO1AKQJD	4.0	Good product, but missing some key features.	2	3	This tablet will give you the basics that you expect from a tablet, especially if you are looking to do functions such as reading/sending email and viewing movies/videos. However, for the price, there are several features which are lacking. Because of the rear facing camera, you cannot use Skype with this tablet. And, even for watching movies, the rear speaker-only, does not do much for enhancing the audio. And, you cannot attach a keyboard to it (at least at this time). Even though it is less expensive than the standard Galaxy 3 Tablet, I feel it is still a bit overpriced, given the features/functions that it lacks. This tablet is light and compact, and if that is important to you, then this could make a nice second or "travel" tablet, or, perhaps one for younger children who do not need all of the features. Otherwise, I would recommend paying the few dollars more and going with the standard Galaxy 3 Tablet.
RSC3L62NMPA64	4.0	samsung tablet	2	3	Well put it this way I have hardly put this down everything about it I love no if ands or buts hands down twice better than an I pad and more than half the price.

R25S6V2WCF9ANA	4.0	Great Tablet at an AWESOME price	0	0	Great Tablet at an AWESOME price! I replaced my wife's old ASUS tablet. The quality of Samsung Galaxy is 100 times better than ASUS. Love everything about it and seems very sturdy and not flimsy like the ASUS tablet. The only downside is screen resolution. it's not an IPS display and not super sharp, however, as it's primary use as a Kindle reader and Facebook Device, it works great!
R3T37V65URZ45Z	1.0	Wouldn't recommend	0	0	It started out fine, but after a couple of months, it was so slow and froze up so frequently it became unusable. It's so bad, the tablet is now stuck in a drawer and we never even attempt to use it anymore. I was very disappointed, especially since I have been a pretty big fan of Samsung. I'm currently on my third version of a Galaxy phone and I generally have been pretty happy with them.
R3MMD9FVFR22J9	1.0	Never dropped the tablet nor did anything hit it Did some research and it seems like the fault is Samsung's	0	0	The tablet developed a horizontal line across the screen after powering up for the first time! Never dropped the tablet nor did anything hit it Did some research and it seems like the fault is Samsung's. I live outside the US so it is very expensive for me to send it back. I guess I will have to either buy a replacement screen or just replace the tablet when I get fedup of using it.
R2487AAPYJLGVC	5.0	Nice tablet	2	3	I am not much of an electronic whiz but I have no problem navigating this tablet. I have downloaded some game apps and others with no problems. The battery life is decent. It's a handy size and I can carry it in some of my pocketbooks. I can't address the camera quality because as of today I haven't used it.
R1F7WHNRIR9NVW	1.0	Most frustraring POS Ever	5	8	My husband has the Samsung Galaxy and I have the Ipad. Since the kids do virtual school and love our tablets I wanted to get them their own. I went with this crap because it was cheap and they only needed them for internet and a few games. The tablets have been nothing but a headache since the day we got them. The charging port is very finicky and half the time the darn thing wont charge. It seems like you need to plug it in at just the right angle, in the right outlet and stand on your hear while holding it in to get it to work.You also can not charge it while it's on and you apparently have to power it down to charge. When it does manage to charge, which can take a whole day, it will only stay charged for 2 hours max. Most of the time it just shuts off and fails to turn on. The parental controls are also crap. With my Ipad I have the option to turn off "in-app" purchases and turn off the app store if I so choose. Not with the tab though. Nope, unless you put it on "kids mode" they can have the run and down load all that their little heart desires. If you do put it on kids mode good luck using most apps, and there is no internet option ether. If you do dare venture on the internet I really hope you are comfy and not planing to move any time soon because it's slow. Actually I think I have seen paint dry faster then I have seen a web page load on this thing. I'm actually thinking of returning them for a refund and going with the Kindle fire, I don't know how much more frustration I can handle.
R2CHNHUWD14ZCV	5.0	GREAT QUALITY!	0	0	I used many tablets (I worked in a retail store in the electronics dept.) and I helped many people set up their tablets. Out of all the tablets, I must say this one has the most quality. Just by holding it you can see the difference, sturdy, and a flawless finish. Very easy to use/set up and durable. So I bought one for my own and I'm very satisfied and happy with my purchase.

I was looking for something that I could carry back & forth to the gym & use it when I am working out on the elliptical or treadmill, something I can watch Netflix on. And that is what I was looking for when I was looking to purchase a tablet. So it has met my expectations & meets my needs.

I added an SD card for extra hard drive space although I havn't used up any where near its basic storage. Lightweight and has a very crisp screen. Have a great battery life which I am thankful for since my Samsung S4 struggles in that department.
R1CMUG3D5ODJCU	4.0	Thank u	0	0	Bought as a gift for my 10 year old and set it up for her, I'm satisfied for all she loves to do with it.

R350OT5EW9B9W1	2.0	Definitely expected better.	0	0	I was hoping for something better than this. The same week that I purchased this item, it would heat up so much just by having it charging. Also, the colors are nowhere near as close as vivid as on any other tablet. Colors are very dull and have hardly any contrast. Also, it doesn't allow you to record on Snapchat. -.-

I have a google nexus that I love and wanted this one because of the expandable memory slot. The screen isn't great at certain angles and I have trouble typing on it. Other then that it works great. The kids love watching netflix on it and the battery holds it charge well.

RVCOGJ2EEL1GL	2.0	Basic tablet	0	0	If you are looking for a basic tablet, this is great. I'm disappointed because I expected more. There are apps and streaming that I can not do because "the device is not compatible". It apparently has to do with the older 'jelly bean' OS And samsung was not sympathetic. Amazon, however is great!
R22JMDA1URPXWM	5.0	my daughter loves it	0	0	This was so worth the price 100$, bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it, I hooked the wifi up to her tablet, and downloaded lots of games for her, my friend bought the same tablet for his daughter but it was 180 and it had problems, he got it from Walmart, so i love amazon

If you're a beginner, and just want a tablet, then this is the one for you! For the price you're definitely getting more than with other tablets in its price
R2Y5NJQY6YH561	4.0	Makes a Great Kids Gift	1	2	I purchased this tablet for a niece. I was looking for an inexpensive tablet with basic features that would allow her to surf the internet, watch Netflix, and play app based games. The setup process for this tablet was frustrating, it took over an hour for me to connect to the home WIFI. The was no button for easy connection to WPS, once connected to the internet the Google Play store kept giving me an error message. I ended up resetting the tablet and starting over. Even though this is a 7 inch tablet it is not the same size as a Galaxy Tab 3 (That is not a Lite version) This is important when searching for a case. On the positive side, the picture quality of the Samsung Galaxy tab 3 lite is far better that other inexpensive tablets that I have viewed. Netflix or other streaming media plays without any delay. In addition to the Google Play store Samsung has there own downloadable apps. While there selection is very limited, I suspect it will grow over time. Like some of the other lower end tablets, I am able to search by voice through Google. The Camera is also capable of making videos and has an acceptable resolution. This tablet has a kid safe app included, so would be acceptable to use as a childs tablet. On black Friday, I was able to get an exceptional deal on this tablet through Amazon. I would recommend this tablet for a child, if you can get the product on sale, along with a sturdy case. The difference between this tablet and other inexpensive tablet seems to be the display and picture quality.
R35WRV8UFRJZNY	4.0	No Front Cam..	2	3	I just received this tablet and so far I enjoy it. I was a little disappointed that it didn't have a front webcam being as though I like to video chat with my friends, but I can survive without it.
R2HT462H0GPM28	5.0	The speakers are not so good like other in tablets	0	0	In general, it is a god inversion. I use it to read e-books, office documents that I am studying or listen to music and watch videos. The speakers are not so good like other in tablets, but I use earphones all the time, so It does not bother me, at all.
RG8P2FH2YA39O	4.0	Nice Little Tablet	0	0	Great little tablet. Very functional, small, and lightweight. So far, its all that I need to read news, listen to streaming radio, input client information, or play an occassional game app. It is slippery to hold so you will need a case for a better grip
R28FGKZ6RIRP2Z	4.0	Very good but always a catch	0	0	This tablet is a great tablet and for that price its even better but the reason it was bought was to play skylanders trap team and of course the catch is it doesn't have bluetooth so now I have to return the skylanders and get it for something else.

R1L0Q6HCCTGA2	3.0	Demo message from being on display?	0	0	The tablet works fine, everything is as expected. The only thing I don't like about it is that it plays the demo message from being in a store when it's inactive. I didn't know that was a part of it being "refurbished". Thanks.

R1G1HW1P3U86F1	4.0	Very pleased with mine!	1	2	First, some back story: I just bought this tablet to replace a horrible mistake I purchased four weeks ago: The RCA 7", which had a screen that must have been made out of jello, because it scratched and scuffed up like someone had been using it as a hockey puck in less than two weeks. The wifi was unreliable, and worst of all, it would not install a Android app I needed for work, which was the very reason I purchased it. Now, I already own a 10" Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, which I am VERY pleased with, but I needed something a little more portable to carry at work. Instead of purchasing the 7" Lite which I really couldn't afford at the time, I went cheap and got the RCA. This item, the Galaxy 3 Lite, is exactly what I need and does what it needs to do for my work, like running the company app, and everything else I would expect a mini tablet to do. The memory is expandable with SD cards, up to 65gb. The lack of a front camera doesn't bother me, and the single, back-facing speaker is not the best, but I prefer earbuds anyway. Why disturb the people around you? This would get a 4.5 star rating from me if I had that rating option. Come on, Amazon, where are our 1/8, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/2 stars? let's get more precise here!
R15DJ9BBOSJ00N	3.0	Well worth the low price	0	0	the price was so low, my wife got one too, in purple. These are the first tablet computers in our home. My wife mainly uses a Windows laptop. I was impressed at how nicely and sturdily built they were for the price.

I don't usually compare, but my China phones and tablets that are not a well known brand work better than this, at half the price! same specs and all. It even feels cheap. Samsung, I know for a fact the Galaxy Tabs are well made, but please, do us all a favor and take this off the line-up.

I have the galaxy s4 and this does most of the stuff my GS4 can do. Overall, great small tablet for a good price.

R1MYBDJ94UINNI	4.0	Tablet met my expectations.	0	0	Tablet met my expectations. I was buying this as a gift for my brother in law. He needed a tablet that would be light enough to carry around whilst meeting his data needs at school. This was the perfect present as it is light andhe can access his school data using WiFi network. The internal storage is big enough for a start and the fact that it is expandable up to 32GB is a plus. The camera too is great - though it could be better as is the case on the Galaxy Phones. But it will do.

R1ICJ89OH35EMC	4.0	Samsung Tab	7	12	The Samsung tab is a pretty good device. It says "lite" but it is very functional and does many operations you would expect a tab to perform. It is about the size of an iPad mini, so for all the loyalist who want to pay an extra $100 or more....go ahead. It fires up very quickly. Apps loaded via Google Play store with no issues. Wi-Fi was recognized very quickly. You can convert the tab to access phone call or text (via Skype and Mighty Text), so presto you have something comparable to your smartphone. The 3 series is pretty good so if you are looking for a device which is functional and easy to learn this is worth a try, as Samsung has done a pretty good job in providing a variety of tablets based on need. I ordered a case which was very nice. It was from Amazon of course, and was under $10.

R1D2AO9WJ7SJI	5.0	Perfect! It's a love!!	0	1	Absolutely love this tablet. I originally ordered the blue green, but exchanged it for the white. It was a Mother's day gift, and the actual color is quite different from the photo on line. I realize that is a possibility, but I just didn't think it was going to be so bright and neon"ish". For mom, the white is much more benign. I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 8.0 edition tablet and Note 3 phone and LOVE them. I am a huge Samsung fan, so I knew this would be a hit. It was. Mom is so happy. It is a little one, but for the simple tasks she will do on it such as Free Cell, Kindle reading, a movie now and then simply surfing the net and emails, this is perfect. I highly recommend this for anyone who just needs a simple tablet. Perfect, especially for the price!!

R28VLIUYMWROB1	3.0	Good tablet but not enough memory	10	17	I purchased this tablet on Friday and returned it on Sunday. It has 8 GB of memory and the pre-loaded apps take up half of that. You cannot store apps on the sd card only pictures and music or other files. Great looking tab however I got the Kindle Fire HDX from QVC saturday night and it came with a quad 4 processor. I got 32 Gb of memory, a protective case, stylus and earbuds for 289.00 This is one of the best 7'' tablets in its class as of today. Samsung is a good company however the memory on the 7'' was not enough for numerous apps. All in all it is an individual choice of what you want the tablet for. happy shopping. Amazon stepped up its game with the new KINDLE FIRE HDX.

R1V3L308YQYXHU	4.0	TABLET	0	1	Tablet was a gift. I'm very happy with it overall but need more memory. So the "giftee" inserted the - much too flimsy - memory card. It didn't make proper connection and was destroyed pulling it out with tweesers. Haven't gotten a new card so we don't know whether the port is destroyed.

R2DZU8AUNP17MS	4.0	Nice tablet	6	11	The tablet has some nice pros going for it. It has a nice feel and it runs smoothly depending on what you do with yours. I use mine while waiting - I ride with people sometimes and read and I sit in the bed and want to lounge - and thought it worked really well for that. I do have to say that I was really surprised by how thick it was when I first got it, then even more surprised by how well it handled considering how thick the item is. There's a light-weight quality to it that allowed me to use it easily, tilting it this way and that while goofing off - I mean testing it. I suppose that's what Lite means. I want to also note that I'm tech-savvy enough to utilize an item, but I'm not going to quote specifications. There are other reviewers doing that and they seem really knowledgeable, so they're a better option for that. I tried the item out and tested it in the real world, using it at the doctor or during breaks or on the go, if that helps any. I played a lot of applications for trial and the tablet ran smoothly, not having some of the hiccups I've noticed in other items when it comes to smaller games. There were a few issues when it came to some of the larger games I've purchased, with the requirements making me pause as it lagged it certain spots. I could adjust settings and control the issues, but there was still so lag. Playback on videos online was nice and movies played great as well, never once having an issue. To me this was a big plus. I also read comics on my tablets, and while a 7 " screen is not the most optimal setup for it, the tablet does a great job with fill and with colors. That's always been an issue for me when using something like a Kindle - perhaps it has been fixed by now, but there was always a framing issue that bothered me. With this, no framing. You can always zoom on frames if so inclined to make up for a smaller screen, which I do with this one. I read a book on it while goofing off; the read went well as expected, which I didn't really doubt. Android readers have always done right by me. Online use is good, no problems noted, with everything from directions to the restaurant to looking up random trivial working out. Other reviewers have mentioned the price, and that is one issue the tablet has going against it. It will get cheaper as time goes on, so while it is an issue while writing this, it won't be for long. Another thing is the 8 GB internal memory, but with the ability to connect a mini-SD to almost every device these days, it wasn't too much for me to consider for myself but something I felt worth noting. I'm not a video-chatter so the lack of one camera does not bother me. I honestly have never liked a camera pointed at my face while using a device, but that's something you might want to look into if that is a selling/buying point.

R1E8SO3UYZDKJ6	1.0	Eh...I will keep my privacy!	3	8	Not a fan of tablet technology due to the EXTREMELY invasive and prying EULAs and the terms to which you agree to just to play some games. Tablet worked well enough but I resold it to someone else due to the privacy invasion. I couldn't play angry birds without opening up my entire network to google and I also would have had to allow them to gps track me...for my kid to play any game. Google play is the only real option you have to download software...no thanks.
