A3UGVZBSBET2R2	1	Overpriced - not 18lb bags!	0	0	When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!
