A114WC65K1IL31	5	Amazing!!!!	6	6	I've taken massive amounts of pain medication over a 30yr. span of<br />time. Last Feb. I started having unbearable problems with my bowels. I tried many different products, diet and colon therapy. Nothing helped. Then I was told about Dr. Hagiwara's line of products....I've been taking the Barleygreen and an other product of his, Fibre Cleanse...(that's how it's spelled)for less than a week and have had amazing results. If you can relate to what I have said...try this product it truly works.  You can find information about the Dr. and his products on the web. Hope this helps somebody.
