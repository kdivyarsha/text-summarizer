A1YDIBMF5N507T	5	Ah-So Sauce	0	0	"Bought this item because it is unavailable out here in AZ, Brought back memories of long ago!! Item's where packaged tightly and arrived in perfect shape. Shipping was incredibly fast and best of all ""FREE"". The price of the items purchased were the lowest I have ever seen. I couldn't have been more pleased. If you have never tried Ah-So sauce, it is a delicious pink rib sauce from New England like you find in Chinese restaurants there and is SOOOO delicious!!! We had the greatest ribs ever. Try some!!!! YUM!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HHD936"">Allied Old English  AH-SO Sauce, Red Rib, Squeeze Bottle, 15-Ounce</a>"
