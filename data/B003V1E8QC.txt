A2WT70BRZ9KH0Y	5	Great fibrous snack	1	1	I tried this product - it is not as sweet as the others that have been around for a long time, and I like the fact they taste fresh and are full of fibers. Order and try for yourself - I don't think you'd be disapoointed :)
A3EWBI2TUG74HQ	5	Great Product!	1	1	"I bought a Goldenvale Jumbo raisin medley at our local grocery store.<br />I normally don't get excited about raisins, but these were among the best I had ever tasted, both in their juiciness AND with the taste combination from the three different kinds of raisins. As I continued munching through half the bag, I couldn't help but think, ""with this kind of taste, who needs to be eating candy! This is as good as most candy I have had!"
