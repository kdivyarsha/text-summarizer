A3DDOZAZ2LJGHG	5	A Wonder for Aching Muscles!	0	0	I have used this product for years and I love it!  I used to run marathons and nothing could touch the aches I would encounter during my training and after my races like this soak.  I don't run anymore due to a severe back injury, but I've used it during my recovery and use it now just to take the edge off of everyday backaches.
