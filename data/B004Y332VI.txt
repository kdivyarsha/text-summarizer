A17AQTJWHGKE79	3	86'd by finicky cats	0	0	Avoderm salmon and chicken did not appeal to my finicky cats, but neither did the plain Avoderm salmon in consomme  (Wild by Nature) either. Since they gobble up the other flavors of Avoderm canned food which make up the bulk of their diet,, I am putting their rejection of this product down to their personal dislike of salmon rather than to any fault of the manufacturer. I have been feeding Avoderm to them for several months and they prefer it to any other brand of canned natural cat food.( and I have tried them ALL!) They are both pictures of good health...luxurious shiny coats with minimal shedding and no dandruff, bright clear eyes, and plenty of energy...which can't be caused by anything else but the Avoderm I feed them ! Highly recommend their canned cat food, so don't let my kittys' personal tastes affect your choice. Avoderm makes a great product!
