AIKOJOKMHE74T	5	My Favorite Tea From My Favorite Tea Retailer	3	3	The good people at Culinary Tea have been pleasing me with the best tea I've ever found for about two years.  Of all the thousands of dollars I've spent with them, this Assam Bukhail estate tea is in my opinion the best investment they offer in tea drinking pleasure.  NO morning tea I ever drank comes close to this tea.  Refreshing, bracing, full of deep full flavor and a so full bodied, I can't imagine life anymore without a cup of this surpassing tea.  If you are a fan of breakfast teas, I think you'll agree this is the best there is!
A1CHKAWX7FAOM4	5	Excellent tea	3	3	This is one of my regular morning teas. The leaves are fine and expand to nearly 3x their dry size. The tea is robust, as an Assam should be, complex, but is just a hair heavy on tannic acid. Don't overbrew to minimize the dry tannic bite.
