A38101DT2MOY60	5	my cat's only true love	5	5	i didn't think my cat could possibly like anything more than weruva canned food... until he tried the weruva pouches. almost all meat with only very tiny pieces of fruit of vegetables added (the bits of pumpkin are super-fine, much smaller than in the canned food). the only downfall is that per ounce they're fairly pricey, and it's hard to get everything out of the pouch because the bottom has a deep fold the food gets stuck in. just make sure you spread out the bottom of the pouch to get everything out -- i like to swish the last bits of meat out with about an ounce of hot water, which turns my cat's dinner into a nice, warm soup.
