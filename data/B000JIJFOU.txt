A243AFBU11QU58	1	rip off	1	2	$5.00 over the local grocer's regular price. I expected a fair market price when I placed this order, but because I didn't research it I was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. Live and learn, I hope I can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return.
