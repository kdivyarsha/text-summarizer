A14PP7PNRXP9S6	5	Great Stuff	3	3	I love this stuff. I was looking for the steak & chop seasoning that I used to be able to buy but found this instead. It's probably the best marinade I've ever used.
AVZ1LIW6EUQIK	4	Excellent marinade	3	3	I use this marinade with inferior cuts of meat which I marinade in a vacumn container for about an hour. Great flavor and very tender. Highly recommend.

A2Y63T9QTZ105B	5	Great tasting Marinade	0	0	We use marinade on a weekly basis, and this is another flavor from Lawry's that is really good.  Not too spicy or overwhelming, making it a good marinade for everyone (even picky kids who don't like spicy tastes).
