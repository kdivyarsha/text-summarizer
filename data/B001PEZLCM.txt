A2S3BPZK6UEH66	4	knee high by the fourth of July	15	16	After making an effort to find seed wheat, and failing, I turned to the internet and got a bag of wheat.<br /><br />this spring, I planted some in the garden, and it is currently knee high, with some lovely heads on it.  I'm looking forward to fall when I can harvest and try the second generation from this bag out.<br /><br />I've already ground some of what didn't get planted into flour and made some delicious whole grain strawberry shortcake...
ABSYREIDT8YKA	5	Good Product for Home Mill	6	6	Just started milling my own wheat; ordered Hard Red & Soft Wheat at same time. Both great packaging & product. Would love to find it locally - but this is next best thing.
AOH7M4L1PXYDU	1	Too Small of a bag	0	4	I was puzzled when the item came in, it was sooooo small unlike the picture.  I dont think I will order this item again, too much money for too little product.
