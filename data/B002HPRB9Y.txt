A5QUYNTWSHC1Z	5	It doesn't get any better than this!	2	2	I am amazed at how yummy this crunchy, chocolate-y, spicy sunflower snack is! It is low in calories, fat, carbs and sodium, yet tastes great. What's nice is that a small handful really does satisfy. I will take a bag with me to the movies or to work for those times when I want a snack but would prefer that it be healthful, too. You cannot go wrong!
A2TN9C5E4A0I3F	4	We liked them	1	1	Since many of these kaia snacks are hit and miss in flavor we bought a bag of about 5 different types of sunflower seeds and kale.. and only found 1 or 2 edible.  This was a better flavor and all was eaten.  We like that it's healthier and sprouted and the spice and cocoa really did a good job of creating a tasty snack.
