A2VY028LEFSBJ	4	Quality product	1	1	I used this tumeric and along with 3 other chili powders ordered in my recipe for the South Florida 2008 Chili Cook-off and placed 21 out of 80 for my 1st attempt.  The product itself is of great quality and lends to a superb taste.  However, my only complaint is that when I originally ordered these products the delivery date was quoted to be within the next 2 business days when i didn't receive it in 3 days I went back onto Amazon to track my order only to see that my entire order was delayed a week without notification.  I like my spices to be as fresh as possible and had they been delayed 1 more day, I would not have had essential ingredients on time.
