A10FL3TBQ7TI48	2	salty	0	0	I ordered 4 20oz boxes. I just opened one and immeadiatly noticed how salty it was. I looked on the box to find it has 570mg of sodium per 2 oz serving. I don't have anything to compare it with right now but it has to much salt for my taste buds and I'm supposed to eat under 1600mg per day for health reasons.<br /><br />To much salt for me but maybe OK for you.
