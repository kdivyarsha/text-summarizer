I ordered them for a baby shower and everyone seemed to enjoy them. they are cute but probably not worth the expensive cost plus shipping. I was stuck in a time crunch so it worked out but would not re-buy.
A2DPFLRFJSEY8Q	1	Ants Loved it More	1	4	We ordered the coins to aid in revealing the gender of our baby at our baby shower two weeks early. When we got home from work we found the box behind the bushes at our front door. The ants had made their way into the package and the cold pack that was included was melted. We did not try to get our money back. We just chalked it up and placed another order thinking we would get the new package delivered to my husband's job in the same quick timeframe. This time we received them 3 days after the shower!!! Never again!!!!!
